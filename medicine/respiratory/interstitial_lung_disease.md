# Interstitial Lung Disease
- heterogenous conditions that cause diffuse parenchymal lung disease
- characterised by chronic inflammation and/or progressive interstitial and share a number of clincia and pathological features

## Background
causes of fibrotic shadowing on CXR
- upper zone: TB, sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, ankylosing spondylitis, radiotherapy, silcosis, berylliosis, pneumoconiosis (coal workers)
- lower zone: idiopathic interstitial pneumonias eg IPF, CTD eg RA, aspiration, asbestosis, medications eg amiodarone methotrexate, infection

pathophysiology
- fibrosis and remodelling of interstitium
- chronic inflammation
- hyperplasia of type II epithelial cells or type II pneumocytes

classification
- exposure related
  - occupational/environmental eg asbestosis, beryllosis, silicosis, cotton worker's lung (byssinosis)
  - drugs eg nitrofuratoin, bleomycin, amiodarone, sulfasalazine, busulfan
  - hypersensitivty reactions eg hypersensitivity pneumonitis
  - infections eg TB, fungi, viral
- associated w/ connective tissue disorder (CTD-ILD)
  - scleroderma, RA
  - SLE, mixed CTD, Sjogren's syndrome
  - polymyositis, dermatomyositis
- granulomatous disease: sarcoidosis
- idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP): idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, non-specific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP), acute interstital pneumonia, and smoking-related ILD including desquamative interstitial pneumonia & respiratory bronchiolitis-associated ILD
- other forms: pulmonary langerhans cell histiocytosis, lymphangioleiomyomatosis

## Presentation
- clubbing
- progressive dyspnoea on exertion
- non-productive paroxysmal cough
- abnormal breath soudns +/- crackles

## Diagnosis
- careful history
  - potential exposures eg inorganic or organic dusts, drugs, radiation
  - features of CTD eg joint pain, dry eyes/mouth, myalgia, Raynauds
  - hobbies
  - home and work environment
- check autoantibodies for specific CTD if clinical suspicion (ANA, RF/CCP, JO-1, CK, SA-A, SA-B, SCL-70, PM1)
- add CK and myositis blot as indicated
- abnormal CXR (reticular, nodular, or mixed pattern of interstitial markings)
- high-res CT (to assess pattern of ILD +/- guide potential BAL/biopsy)
- restrictive pulmonary spirometry w/ dec DLCO

## Management
- specific treatment depending on underlying condition eg immunosuppression for CTD-ILD or sarcoidosis
- antifibrotic for IPF or for progressive fibrosing ILD eg pirfenidone, nintedanib
- supportive care: supplemental O2 if indicated, pulmonary rehab
- assess and treat comorbidities and complications eg GORD and PH
- manage acute exacerbations w/ eg antibiotics, steroids as indicated
- progressive disease: refer for lung transplant; if not candidate, discuss future ventilation decisions, and consider palliative care involvement if appropriate
