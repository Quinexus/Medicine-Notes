# Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
IPF, also known as usual intersitial pneumonia (UIP) is most common type of idiopathic pneumonia (IIP)

##Â Background
RF:
- genetic predisposition
- smoking
- environmental pollutants
- chronic microaspiration

repetitive alveolar epithelial injury triggers -> early development fibrosis

commonest cause of interstitial lung disease

age on onset: typically 60+yrs (M > F)

## Presentations
symptoms
- dry cough
- exertional dyspnoea
- malaise
- dec weight
- arthralgia
signs
- cyanosis
- finger clubbing
- fine end-inspiratory crepitations

complications
- respiratory failure
- PH
- inc risk of lung cancer
- comorbid emphysema
- OSA

## Diagnosis
blood
- ABG: dec PaO2 if severe inc PaCO2
- inc CRP
- inc immunoglobulins
- ANA or RF may be +ve if assoc w/ CTD
imaging
- CXR: inc reticular markings
- HRCT: characteristic features include 
  - apicobasal gradient of peripheral (subpleural)
  - reticular opacities assoc w/ architectural distortion
  - including honeycomb changes and traction bronchiectasis or bronchiolectasis

spirometry: restrictive and dec transfer factor
BAL
- limited role in diagnosis
- only indicated to rule out alterative diagnosis
- may indicate activity of alveolitis: inc lymphocytes (good response/prognosis) or inc neutrophils and inc eosinophils (poor response/prognosis)
lung biopsy
- all pts must have MDT discussion
- biopsy may be required for diagnosis depending on MDT consensus if clinical and imaging features are inconclusive
- histology on biopsy in UIP: heterogenous appearance w/ alternating areas of normal lung, fibrosis, fibroblast foci, and honeycomb change

## Management
- supportive care
  - oxygen
  - pulmonary rehab
  - influenza
  - pneumococcal vaccination
  - treat GORD
- antifibrotic therapies: pirfenidone or nintedanib - shown to slow disease progression
- all pts considered to current clinical trials or early referral for lung transplantation (for those w/ progressive disease and minimal comorbidities)
- strongly recommended that high-dose steroids not used except where diagnosis of IPF is in doubt or short course to treat acute exacerbations along w/ broad-spectrum ABx

prognosis
- median survival ranges: from 2-5yrs
