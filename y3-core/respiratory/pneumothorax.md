# Pneumothorax

Simple - Air in the pleural cavity
Tension - air drawn in without escape, builds up and pushes mediastinum, compressing great vessels -> CR arrest (if not intervened)

## Background

causes: 
- 1ary spontaneous (young, thin men) subpleural bulla rupture
- 2ary to lung or CT disorders
- trauma/iatrogenic

## Presentation
- symptoms
    - asymptomatic (small)
    - sudden onset SOB +/- pleurtic cp
    - deteroiration of asthma/COPD
    - mechanical ventiallatory
- signs
    - reduced expansion
    - hyperresonance to percussion
    - reduced breath sounds on affected side
    - tension pneumothorax - tracheal deviation, haemodynamic compromise, distended neck veins
- high risk characteristics
    - tension or haemodynamic compromise
    - significant hypoxia
    - b/l
    - 2ary

## Diagnosis
- CXR (ideally shouldn't need for tension) - no lung markings seen on periphery
- O2 sats and ABG (dyspnoea and lung disease)
- CT thorax - emphysema bulla vs pneumothorax

## Management
- analgesia + O2 (hypoxia)
- management options:
    - needle aspiration 16-18G cannula
    - chest drain insertion - small tube (unless blood/pus), can use -ve pressure suction, remove tubes 24h after lung re-expanded and air leak stopped (drain stops bubbling), remove duing valsalva or expiration
- management algorithm:
    - no symptoms or <2cm or 1ary manageable - watch and wait, 1ary 2-4d & 2ary in-patient
    - high risk (or unsucessful puncture) -> chest drain + consider cardiothoracics OTHERWISE puncture (or ambulatory device w/ 2-3d review)
    - cardiothoracic input also if lung failed to expand in 48j of chest drain, 2+ PMH pneumothorax on same side or 1 on other side, high risk occupation
