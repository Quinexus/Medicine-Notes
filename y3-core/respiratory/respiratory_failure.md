# Respiratory failure
- occurs when gas exchange is inadequate, resulting in hypoxia
- defined as PaO2 <8kPa and subdivided into 2 types according to PaCO2 level

## Background
type I respiratory failure
- hypoxia (PaO2 <8kPa) w/ normal or low PaCO2
- caused primarily by ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch, abnormal diffusion, right-to-left cardiac shunts
- examples of V/Q mismatch: PE, pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, asthma, emphysema, ARDS

type II respiratory failure
- hypoxia (PaO2 <8kPa) w/ hypercapnia (PaCO2 >6kPa)
- caused by alveolar hypoventilation w/ or w/o V/Q mismatch
- causes
  - pulmonary disease: COPD, pneumonia, end-stage pulmonary fibrosis, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome (inc prevalence)
  - reduced respiratory drive: sedative drugs, CNS tumour or trauma
  - neuromuscular disease: cervical cord lesion, diaphragmatic paralysis, poliomyelitis, myasthenia gravis, guillain-barre syndrome
  - thoracic wall disease: flail chest, kyphoscoliosis

## Presentation
features of underlying cause together w/ symptoms and signs of hypoxia w/ or w/o hypercapnia

hypoxia
- dyspnoea
- restlessness
- agitation
- confusion
- central cyanosis
- if long standing
  - polycythaemia
  - pulmonary HTN
  - cor pulmonale

hypercapnia
- headache
- peripheral vasodilation
- tachycardia
- bounding pulse
- tremor/flap
- papilloedema
- confusion
- drowsiness
- coma

## Diagnosis
aimed at determining underlying cause
- blood tests: FBC, U+E, CRP, ABG
- radiology: CXR +/- CT thorax/CTPA
- microbiology: COVID/flu swab, respiratory BioFire PCR panel, sputum and blood cultures (if febrile)
- spirometry: COPD, neuromuscular disease, GBS

##Â Management
- depends on cause
- senior support essential
- at early stage consider appropriateness of management setting and ceilings of care

T1RF
- treat underlying cause
- give oxygen (24-60%)
- get ICU support and consider high flow nasal cannula or CPAP if requiring >40% O2
  - latter is mask covering nose and mouth that provides fixed positive pressure to airways throughout breathing cycles, to splint open respiratory tract and improve gas exchange
  - standard CPAP starting pressure usually 5cmH20
  - most useful in CHF, COPD, or OSA

T2RF: respiratory centre may be relatively insensitive of CO2 and respiration could be driven by hypoxia
- treat underlying cause
- controlled O2 therapy: target SpO2 of 88-92% if COPD and history of CO2 retention
  - start at 24% O2
  - oxygen therapy should be given w/ care
- recheck ABG after 20 min
  - if PaCO2 is steady or lower, increase O2 conc to 28%
  - if PaCO2 has risen >1.5kPa and pts is still hypoxic, consider assisted ventilation
- if fails consider intubation and ventilation if appropriate
