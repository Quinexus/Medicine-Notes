# Pulmonary Embolism

## Background
aetiology
- VTE in pelvis/legs: clots break off -> veins -> R heart -> pulmonary circ
- rare: RV thrombus (post-MI); septic embolic (R-sided endocarditis); fat, air or amniotic fluid embolism; neoplastic cells; parasites

rfs
- recent surgery esp abdo/pelvic or hip/knee replacement
- thrombophilia
- leg fracture
- proloned bed rest/reduced mobility
- malignancy
- pregnancy/postpartum, combined contraceptive pill, HRT
- previous PE

classification
- haemodynamic stability 
- temporal pattern (acute, subacute, chronic)
- anatomical location (saddle, lobar, segmental, subsegmental)
- presence or absence of symptoms

## Presentation
- small emboli may be asymptomatic, large emboli often fatal
- symptoms: acute SOB, pleurtic CP, haemoptysis, dizziness, syncope; ask RF, PMH, FH of VTE
- signs: pyrexia, cyanosis, tachypnoea, tachycardia, hypotension; raised JVP; pleural rub; pleural effusion; look for sign of cause

## Diagnosis
- depends on pretest probability assessment
    - calculate modified Wells
    - >4: immediate CTPA or treat empircally (LMWH) if delay
    - <4: D-dimer -> +ve = immediate CTPA or empircal treatment LMWH
- FBC, U+E, baseline clotting, D-dimers; ABG may show dec PaO2 and dec PaCO2; troponin may help risk stratification
- Imaging: CTPA or less commonly V/Q scan are definitive; CXR may be normal or show oligaemia of affected segment, dilated Pulmonary artery, linear atelectasis, small pleural effusion, wedge-shaped opacities, or cavitation (rare)
- ECG: normal or tachy, RBBB, RV strain (inverted T in V1-V4); classical S1Q3T3 rare

unprovoked
- consider malignancy assessment
- full Hx, exam, CXR, FBC, Ca2+, LFTs, U+E, PT, APTT, urinalysis
- otherwise age-appropriate malignancy unless suggestive symptoms
- consider antiphospholipid and thrombophilia testing if FHx or recurrent episode

## Management
- if haemodynamically unstable -> thrombolyse for massive PE
- if thrombolysis contraindicated -> catheter-directed thrombectomy or (rarely) surgical embolectomy
- if haemodynamically stable -> start LMWH or oral factor Xa inhibitors
    - warfarin in some cases eg reduced GFR <15
    - for warfarin stop heparin when INR is 2-3 due to initial prothrombotic effect
- consider placement of vena caval filter if CI to anticoagulation

length of treatment
    - provoked: 3 months and reassess risk to benefit profile (depends on whether RF persist)
    - unprovoked: treatment usually >3 monhts (people w/ no identified RF)
    - malignancy: continued treatment w/ LMWH for 6 months or until cure of cancer
    - pregnancy: LMWH continued until delivery/end of pregnancy

prevention
    - LMWH to all inpatients
    - stop HRT and oestrogen-based contraceptive pill pre-op (may need alternate contraception for peri-op period)
