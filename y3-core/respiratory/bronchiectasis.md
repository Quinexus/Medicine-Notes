# Bronchiectasis

## Background
pathophysiology
- chronic inflammation of bronchi and bronchioles -> permenant dilatation and thinning of airways
- induction of bronchiectasis requires infectious insult + impairment of drainage, airway obstruction, and/or defect in host defence
- exacerbations: acute bacterial infections - H. influenzae; Strep pneumoniae; Staph aureus; pseudomonas aeruginosa

causes
- congenital: CF; young's syndrome; primary ciliary dyskinesia; Kartagener's syndrome
- post-infection: measles; pertussis; bronchiolitis; pneumonia; TB; HIV
- other: bronchial obstruction (tumour, foreign body); allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis; hypogammaglobulinaemia; rheumatoid arthritis; ulcerative colitis; idiopathic

## Presentation
- symptoms: persistent cough; copious purulent sputum; intermittent haemoptysis
- signs: finger clubbing; coarse inspiratory crepitations; wheeze (asthma, COPD, ABPA)
- complications: pneumonia, pleural effusion; pneumothorax; haemoptysis; cerebral abscess; amyloidosis

## Diagnosis
- sputum culture
- CXR: cystic shadows, thickened bronchial walls (tramline and ring shadows)
- HRCT chest
    - required to diagnose and assess extent and distribution of disease
    - airway dilatation, lack of airway tapering, bronchial thickening, and cysts
- spirometry: typically obstructive pattern; reversibility assessed
- bronchoscopy: exclude obstruction and obtain samples for culture

other
- CT angio: investigate site of bleeding/embolise target if significant haemoptysis
- serum immunoglobulins
- CF sweat test or CFTR genotyping
- test for primary ciliary dyskinesia eg saccharin, nasal brushing, nasal NO;
- aspergillus precipitins or skin-prick test RAST and total IGE

## Management
- treat underlying disease where possible
- airway clearance techniques and mucolytics: chest physio and devices (flutter value) -> sputum expectoration and mucus drainage
- antibiotics: according to sensitivities but azithromycin freq used prophylactically
    - pseudomonas needs either oral cipro or suitable IV
    - if >= 3 exacerbations/yr -> long-term antibiotics (may be nebs)
- bronchodilators (eg neb salbutamol): useful in pts w/ asthma, COPD, CF, ABPA
- corticosteroids and itraconazole for ABPA
- surgery: for localised disease or control severe haemoptysis; bronchial artery embolisation needed for pts w/ brisk haemoptysis
- other: immunisations, PPI if GORD present; pulmonary rehab for pts w/ moderate-to-severe airflow limitation on PFTS
