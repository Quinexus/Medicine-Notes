# Pleural Effusion
- fluid in pleural space
- divided based on protein concentration
    - transudates (<25)
    - exudates (>35)
- blood = haemothorax
- pus = empyema
- chyle (lymph w/ fat) = chylothorax
- blood + air = haemopneumothorax

## Background
causes
- transudates
    - inc venous pressure: HF, constrictive pericarditis, fluid overload
    - hypoproteinaemia: cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, malabsorption
    - hypothyroidism
    - Meig's syndrome (R pleural effusion & ovarian fibroma)
- exudates: increased leakiness of pleural capillaries
    - infection
    - inflammation
    - malignancy
    - causes: pneumonia, TB; pulmonary infarction; RA; SLE; bronchogenic carcinoma; malignant metastases; lymphoma; mesothelioma; lymphangitic carcinomatosis

## Presentation
symptoms: asymptomatic OR dyspnoea, pleuritic CP
signs
    - decreased expansion
    - stony dull percussion note
    - diminished breath sound
    - dec tactile vocal fremitus and vocal resonance (inconstant & unreliable)
    - bronchial breathing (above effusion, where lung is compressed)
    - tracheal deviation away from effusion
    - look for aspiration marks
    - signs of associated disease: malignancy (cachexia, clubbing, lymphadenopathy, ratiation marks, mastectomy scar); stigmata of chronic liver disease; HF; hypothyroidism; RA; butterfly rash of SLE

## Diagnosis
CXR
    - small effusions: blunt costophrenic angles
    - large effusions: water-dense shadows w/ concave upper borders
    - completely flat horizontal upper border implies that there is also a pneumothorax

US: useful in identifying presence of pleural fluid and in guiding diagnostic or therapeutic aspiration; detects pleural fluid septations w/ greater sensitivity than CT scanning

diagnostic aspiration
- all aspirates should be US-guided to improve success rate, reduce complications (inc pneumothorax), and reduce risk of organ puncture
- infiltrate down to pleura w/ 5-10mL of 1% lidocaine
- attach 21G needle to syringe and insert just above upper border of an appropriate rib (avoids neurovascular bundle)
- draw off 10-30mL pleural fluid -> lab for: 
    - clinical chemistry: protein, glucose, pH, LDH, amlyase
    - bacteriology: MC&S, auramine stain, TB culture
    - cytology: malignant effusions can be diagnosed based on pleural fluid cytology results in 60% cases
    - immunology: RF, ANA, complement
- send adenosine deaminase if ?TB effusion
- Light's Criteria: exudate vs transudate, need total protein & LDH values both in blood and pleural fluid

- gross appearance
    - clear, straw-coloured: transudate, exudate
    - turbid, yellow: empyema, parapneumonic effusion
    - haemorrhagic: trauma, malignancy, pulmonary infarction
- cytology
    - neutrophils++: parapneumonic effusion, PE
    - lymphocytes++: malignancy, TB, RA, SLE, sarcoidosis
    - mesothelial cells++: pulmonary infarction
    - abnormal mesothelial cells: mesothelioma
    - multinucleated giant cells: RA
    - lupus erythematosus cells: SLE
    - malignant cells: malignancy
- clinical chemistry
    - protein <25: transudate
    - protein >35: exudate
    - protein 25-35: use Light's criteria
        - if pleural fluid protein/serum protein >0.5
        - or pleural LDH/serum LDH >0.6
        - = exudate
    - glucose <3.3, pH <7.2, inc LDH (pleural:serum >0.6): empyema, malignancy, TB, RA, SLE
    - inc amylase: pancreatitis, carcinoma, bacterial pneumonia, oesophageal rupture
- immunology
    - RF: RA
    - ANA: SLE
    - inc complement levels: RA, SLE, malignancy, infection

CT thorax: pleural phase contrast enhancement all pts w/ an undiagnosed exudative pleural effusion; distinguish malignant from benign pleural thickening

pleural biopsy
- if pleural fluid analysis inconclusive, consider parietal pleural biopsy
- thoracoscopic or CT-guided pleural biopsy increases diagnostic yield (by enabling direct visualisation of pleural cavity and biopsy of suspicious areas)

## Management
- drainage: 
    - if symptomatic or empyema present: drain it, repeatedly if necessary
    - fluid is best removed slowly (0.5-1.5L/24h)
    - may aspirated same way as a diagnostic tap or using an intercostal drain
- pleurodesis: 
    - w/ talc may be helpful for recurrent effusions
    - thoracoscopic mechanical pleurodesis most effective for malignant effusions
    - empyemas are best drained using chest drain, inserted after US or CT guidance
- intra-pleural alteplase & dornase alfa: may help w/ empyema
- surgery: persistent collections and increasing pleural thickening requires surgery
