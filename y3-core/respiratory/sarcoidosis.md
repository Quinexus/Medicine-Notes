# Sarcoidosis

## Background
- multisystem granulomatous disease of unknown cause
- highest prevalance in Northern Europe
- ~20-40yrs F>M
- black > caucasian particularly extrathoracic
- assoc HLA-DRB1 and DQB1

## Presentation
- 20-40% incidentally on CXR -> asymptomatic
- acute: fever, erythema nodosum, polyarthralgia, and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy; also called Lofgren syndrome; resolves spontanously

- pulmonary disease: 90% abnormal CXR w/ BHL +/- pulmonary infiltrates or fibrosis
    - symptoms: dry cough, progressive dyspnoea, dec exercise tolerance, CP
    - 10-20% progress and deteriorate lung function
- non-pulmonary
    - legion
        - lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly
        - uveitis, conjunctivitis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, glaucoma
        - terminal pharyngeal bone cysts
        - enlargement of lacrimal & parotid glands; Bell's palsy
        - neuropathy, meningitis, brainstem & spinal syndromes, space-occupying lesions
        - erythema nodosum, lupus pernio, subcutaneous nodules
        - cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias
        - hypercalcaemia, hypercalciuria, renal stones, pituitary dysfunction

## Diagnosis
- bloods: inc ESR, lymphopenia, inc LFT, inc serum ACE in ~60%, inc Ca2+, in IgG
- 24h urine: inc Ca2+
- CXR: abnormal in 90%
    - stage 0: normal, stage 1: BHL, stage 2: BHL + peripheral pulmonary infiltrates alone, stage 4: progressive upper lobe pulmonary fibrosis
    - bulla formation (honeycombing)
    - pleural involvement
- ECG: may show arrhythmia or bundle branch block
- lung function: normal or dec lung volumes, impaired gas transfer, & restrictive
- tissue biopsy (lung, liver, lymph, skin nodules, or lacrimal glands): diagnostic and shows non-caseating granulomata
- bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL): inc lymphocytes in active disease; inc neutrophils in pulmonary fibrosis
- transbronchial biopsy: may be diagnostic
- ultrasound: nephrocalcinosis or hepatosplenomegaly
- hand XR: 'punched out' lesions in terminal phalanges
- CT/MRI 
    - severity of pulmonary disease or diagnosing neurosarcoidosis
    - ECG, caridac MRI or PET-CT if ?cardiac
    - opthal assessment if ?ocular disease

differentials of granulomatous disease
- infections
    - bacteria: TB, leprosy, syphilis, cat scratch fever
    - fungi: cryptococcus neoformans, coccidioides immitis
    - protozoa: schistosomiasis
- autoimmune: PBC, granulomatous orchitis
- vasculitis: giant cell, polyarteritis nodosa, takayasu's; GPA
- organic dust disease: silicosis, berylliosis
- idiopathic: Crohn's, De Quervain's, Sarcoid
- extrinsic allergic alveolitis

causes of BHL
- sarcoidosis
- infection eg. TB, mycoplasma
- malignancy eg lymphoma, carcinoma, mediastinal tumour
- organic dust disease eg silicosis, berylliosis
- hypersensitivity pneumonitis
- histocytosis x (langerhans cell histiocytosis)

## Management
- no treatment for BHL alone as most recovers spontaneously
- acute: steroids if significant respiratory disease/compromise or end-organ damage
- NSAIDs for joint disease or Lofgren

indications for steroids
- parenchymal lung disease (symptomatic, static, or progressive)
- uveitis
- hypercalcaemia
- neurological or cardiac involvement
prednisolone for 4-6wks then dec dose over 1yr according to clinical status; few spts relapse and may need further course of long-term therapy

other
- severe illness: IV methylpred or immunosuppressants (methotrexate, azathioprine, leflunomide, and mycophenolate) may be needed
- anti-TNFa therapy for refractory cases
- lung transplantation may be needed in advanced pulmonary fibrosis w/ or w/o PH

prognosis: variable rates (30-80%) of spontaneous remission depending on stage
