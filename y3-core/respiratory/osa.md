# Obstructive Sleep Apnoea
- intermittent closure/collapse of pharyngeal airway causing apnoeic episodes during sleep
- terminated by partial arousal
- recurrent episodes -> chronic intermitted hypoxia, sleep fragmentation, inflammatory activation

## Background
RFs: age, male, obesity, craniofacial/upper airway abnormalities, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, pregnancy, stroke, CHF, hypothyroidism

## Presentation
- loud snoring, gasping, choking, snorting or apnoic episodes during sleep
- daytime somnolence + dec cognitive performance, poor sleep quality, morning headache, decreased libido, nocturia
- check epworth sleepiness scale (>9 indicates abnormal sleepiness)

## Diagnosis
- offer home respiratory polygraphy
- if unavailable/impractical arrange in-hospital polysomnography (monitors O2 sats, airflow at nose and mouth, ECG, EMG chest, and abdo wall movement during sleep) which is diagnostic
- occurance of >= 5 episodes of apnoea/hypoapnoea during 1h of sleep indicates sleep apnoea (>30 = severe)

## Management
- weight reduction, exercise, changing sleep position
- avoid tobacco & alcohol
- mandibular advancement device
- CPAP during sleep effective and recommended by NICE for those w/ moderate to severe disease
- surgery to relieve pharyngeal or nasal obstruction eg tonsillectomy or polypectomy
