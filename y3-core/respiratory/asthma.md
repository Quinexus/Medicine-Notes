# Chronic Asthma

## Background
- 8% prevalence
- reversible airway obstruction/airway narrowing
  - bronchoconstriction: triggered by stimuli
  - muscosal swelling/inflammation: caused by mast cell and basophil release of inflammatory mediatorys
  - increased mucus production
- other asthma syndromes, onset in adulthood
  - occupational
  - aspirin-sensitive
  - oesinophilic

## Presentation
symptoms
- episodic >= 1 of below occuring in episodes w/ periods of no (or minimal) symptoms between episodes
  - wheeze
  - SOB
  - chest tightness
  - cough
- precipitants
  - respiratory irritants
  - allergens
  - infection
  - drugs (NSAIDS: inc leukotrienes, bb: bronchospasm)
  - cold air
  - exercise (typically after 5-15mins)
- diurnal variation: symptoms/peak flow
  - vary over day but worse at night or early morning
  - morning dipping peak flow common -> serious attack possible despite normal at other times
- exercise tolerance diminished
- disturbed sleep (quantify nights per week)
- acid reflux (40-60%, treating improves spirometry > symptoms)
- other atopy: eczema, hay fever, allergy, FHx
- home (esp bedroom): pets? carpet? feather pillows/duvet? floor cushions and other 'soft furnishing'
- job
  - symptoms remit weekends and holidays?
  - 15% cases work-related
  - measure peak flow at intervals at work and at home
- exacerbations
  - frequency
  - severity
  - duration
  - required treatment: steroids, A+E visits, hospitalisations and intubations
  - days per week of work and school
  - adherence to treatment, inhaler technique

signs
- tachypnoea
- audible wheeze
- hyperinflated chest
- hyperresonant percussion note
- dec air entry
- widespread polyphonic wheeze w/ prolonged expiratory phase
- presence of: nasal polyps, rhinitis, rash (allergic)

## Diagnosis
clinical supported objective tests to demonstrate variable airflow obstruction or presence of airway inflammation
compare results w/ asymptomatic vs symptomatic to avoid false negative results and to detect variation over time

initial diagnosis: initial structured clinical assessment + diagnostic algorithm

- high probability
  - features
    - episodic symptoms ('attacks')
    - wheeze
    - variable airflow obstruction
    - history of atopy
    - no features suggestive of alternative diagnosis
  - testing strategy
    1. commence monitored treatment (6wks of inhaled steroids)
    2. assess status w/ symptom questionnaire and/or PFTs (lung function tests)
    3. confirm diagnosis w/ response to treatment
    4. if response poor, check inhaler technique and arrange further tests
- intermediate probability
  - features
    - some but not all typical features of asthma
    - does not respond well to a monitored initiation of treatment
  - testing strategy
    1. spirometry w/ reversibility tests and/or monitored initiation of treatment
    2. assess response by repeating PFTs
    3. if normal spirometry results, do challenge tests and/or measurement of FeNO to identify eosinophilic inflammation
- low probability
  - features
    - no typical features
    - symptoms suggest alternative diagnosis
  - testing strategy
    1. investigate for alternative diagnosis
    2. undertake/refer for further asthma tests

BTS/SIGN guidelines (2019)

diagnostic indications for referral for specialist advice/investigations
- referral for tests not available in primary care
  - diagnosis unclear
  - ? occupational asthma
  - poor response to asthma treatment
  - severe/life-threatening asthma attack
- 'red flags' and indicators of other diagnosis
  - prominent systemic features (myalgia, fever, weightloss)
  - unexpected clinical findings
  - persistent invariable breathlessness
  - chronic sputum production
  - unexplained restrictive spirometry
  - CXR shadowing
  - marked blood eosinophilia

acute attack
- PEF, sputum culture, FBC, U+E, CRP, blood cultures
- ABG normal or slightly dec PaO2 but dec PaCO2 (hyperventilation)
- if PaO2 normal but pt is hyperventilating, watching carefully and repeat ABG a little later
- if PaCO2 normal or raised, transfer to high-dependency unit or ITU for close monitoring +/- ventilatory support = failing respiratory effort
- CXR 

chronic asthma
- PEF monitoring for 2-4wks: diurnal variation of >15% on >=3d a wk for 2wks
- spirometry: obstructive defect (dec FEV1/FVC, inc RV); usually >=12% improvement in FEV1 following beta2 agonists or steroid trial w/ increase in volume >=200mL (=significant reversibility)
- histamine or methacholine bronchial challenge tests
- FeNO to detect eosinophilic airway inflammation or atopy
- CXR: hyperinflammation

allergy tests
- perform to confirm sensitivity to ?allergic triggers - suggested by inc allergic-specific IgE levels, +ve skin-prick tests to aeroallergens or blood eosinophilia
- consider ABPA and check Aspergillus serology if eosinophilia, a positive skin test to Aspergillus, mucus plugging, or central bronchiectasis on CXR

differential diagnosis
- pulmonary oedema ('cardiac asthma')
- COPD (may coexist)
- large airway obstruction (eg foreign body, tumour - consider if focal, monophonic wheeze)
- SVC obstruction (wheeze/dyspnoea not episodic)
- pneumothorax
- PE
- bronchiectasis
- obliterative bronchiolitis (?elderly)
- post-viral tussive syndrome
- churg-strauss syndrome (asthma may precede vasculitic phase by 8-10yrs)
- hyperventilation and panic attack

coexistent conditions
- allergic rhinitis (in most; postnasal drip = 'integrated airway hypothesis')
- sinus disease (as per allergic rhinitis, inflammation in upper airways can drive inflammation in lower airways, exacerbating asthma)
- obesity (may worsen perception of symptom severity)
- GORD
- all can worsen asthma symptoms

be aware: difficult asthma may be associated w/ psychological morbidity

natural history
- most childhood asthmatics either grow out of asthma in adolescence or suffer much less as adults
- 'new-onset' asthma in adulthood sometimes has its origins in undiagnosed childhood asthma
- risk of progressive clinical deterioration in adults is small, and asthma in absence of other comorbidities does not appear to decrease life expectancy
- pts w/ severe asthma and one or more adverse psychosocial factors are at risk of death

mortality: 1320 asthma deaths in UK in 2017; 20% increase in last 5 years

## Management

lifestyle
- quit smoking
- avoid precipitants
- weight loss if overweight
- check inhaler technique
- teach use of peak flow meter to monitor PEF 2x/day
- offer self-management education which should include a written personalised asthma action plan w/ specific advice about what to do in emergency and how to alter their medication in light of symptoms or PEF
- breathing exercise programmes have shown to improve QoL & reduce symptoms

global initiative for asthma guidelines
- start at step most appropriate to severity
- moving up if needed, or down if control is good for >3 mnths
- before initiating new therapy, check adherence w/ existing therapies, check inhaler technique, and eliminate trigger factors
- treat modifiable RFs and comorbidities

- treatment w/ SABA alone w/o ICS is no longer recommended -> inc exacerbations
- all adults w/ asthma should now recieve ICS
- can be either symptom-driven (in mild asthma) or daily, to reduce risk of serious exacerbations and to control symptoms

- step 1 intermittent asthma (symptoms < 2x/mnth): combination inhaler of low-dose ICS and LABA as needed for symptoms relief; alternatively use low-dose ICS whenever as SABA is needed
- step 2 mild persistent (symptoms >= 2x/mnth but < than daily): daily low-dose ICS + as-needed SABA or as-needed low-dose ICS-LABA; LTRA are alternative if avoiding ICS, but less efficacious
- step 3 moderate persistent (symptoms most days, or waking w/ asthma once a week or more): low-dose ICS-LABA maintenance and reliver therapy (preferred) or daily low-dose ICS-LABA maintenance plus as-needed SABA; consider addition LAMA if LABA contraindicated/not tolerated; less effective alternatives: medium dose inhaled ICS + as-needed SABA or low-dose ICS w/ LTRA
- step 4 severe persistent (symptoms most days, or waking w/ asthma once a week or more, or low lung function): medium-dose ICS-LABA as maintenance and reliever therapy; alternative options include high-dose ICS, add-on tiotropium, or add-on LTRA
- step 5: high-dose ICS-LABA; refer for phenotypic assessment +/- add-on therapy, eg tiotropium, anti-IgE, anti-IL-5, anti-IL-4R; some pts may benefit from low-dose oral corticosteroids but long-term systemic SE are common and serious

at each step, every pt should also have reliever inhaler, either low-dose ICS-formoterol (preferred) or SABA

- corticosteroids
  - best inhaled to minimise systemic effects
  - spacer but also PO or IV
  - act over days to dec bronchial mucosal inflammation
  - rinse mouth after inhaled steroids to prevent oral candidiasis
  - oral steroids are used acutely (high-dose, short courses) and longer term in lower dose if control is not optimal on inhalers
- B2-adrenoceptor agonists
  - relax bronchial smooth muscle (inc CAMP), acting w/in minutes
  - salbutamol best given by inhalation (aerosol, powder, nebuliser), but may also be given PO or IV
  - SE: tachyarrhythmias, dec K+, tremor, anxiety
- anticholinergics
  - may dec muscle spasm synergistically w/ b2-agonists
  - an add-on option at step 4 or 5 by mist inhaler for pts w/ history of exacerbations despite ICS +/- LABA
  - SE: dry mouth, URTI
- leukotriene receptor antagonists
  - block effects of cysteinyl leukotrienes in airways by antagonising the CystLT1 receptor
- cromoglicate (mast cell stabiliser)
  - very limited role in long-term treatment of asthma
  - weak anti-inflammatory effect, less effective than low-dose ICS
  - require meticulous inhaler maintenance
  - SE: cough upon inhalation, pharyngeal discomfort
- anti-IgE monoclonal antibody (omalizumab)
  - highly selected pts w/ persistent allergic asthma who have high IgE level and documented sensitivity to a perennial allergen
  - given as s/c injection every 2-4wks depending on dose
  - specialists prescribe only
- anti-IL-5: reduce exacerbations in severe eosinophilic asthma
- anti-IL-4 receptor alpha-subunit antibody: reduces exacerbations in moderate-to-severe, eosinophilic asthma

prescribe beclometasone by brand name, because, dose for dose, is twice as potent as other available CFC-free brand

any dose >=250mcg ~ significant steroid absorption: carry steroid card, this recommendation is being widened and lower doses and now said to merit steroid card
