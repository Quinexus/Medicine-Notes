# Heart Failure
Failure to pump blood around the body and meet the metabolic demands of the heart

## Background
- Epidemiology: 1/10 elderly
- Poor prognosis ~25-50% die w/in 5yrs diagnosis, w/ admission -> 75%! Be realistic!

Classification
- HFrEF: pump failure -> dec CO (systolic) -> eccentric (dilated not thickened) remodelling, causes: MI, cardiomyopathy
- HFpEF: relaxation failure -> increased pressures (diastolic) -> concentric remodelling/hypertrophy often, causes: HTN, CAD, CKD, obes, infiltrative, constrictive pericarditis

## Presentation
symptoms relate to side of heart (r -> body, l -> lung) and fluid overload
- LVF: 
    - SOB(OE) w/ pain (dyspnoea), on lying (orthopnoea), on sleeping (PND), breathing (wheeze/cardiac asthma), at night (noctural cough +/- pink frothy sputum) 
    - other: fatigue, cold peripheries and weight loss
- RVF (LVF, pulmonary stenosis or lung disease = cor pulmonale): periperal oedema, ascites, nausea, anorexia, facial engorgment, epistaxis 
- LVF + RVF = CCF

- acute HF: new or decompensation w/ r/l symptoms w/or w/o peripheral hypoperfusion
- chronic HF: slow

- low-output: low CO even on exertion
    - causes - excessive preload, pump failure (sys/diastolic HF, dec HR, negative inotropic drugs), chronic excessive afterload (eg AS, HTN)
    - preload ->  dilation -> pump failure -> systolic dysfunction
    - afterload -> hypertrophy -> stiff walls -> diastolic dysfunction
- high-output: rarer, normal/increased output, failure to meet metabolic needs
    - causes: anaemia, pregnancy, hyperthy, paget's, AVM, beriberi

## Diagnosis
Clinical
- symptoms + evidence of dysfunction at rest
- signs: cyanosis, dec BP, narrow pulse pressure, pulsus alterans, displaced apex, RV heave (pulmonary HTN), signs of valve disease
- NYHA classification: I feels normal, II SOBOE, III SOBOE limiting, IV SOB at rest

Simple - ECG + NT-proBNP (<400) normal = unlikely HF, consider alternative else echo
ECG for cause, Echo for cause and diagnosis. Can use CiMR or Endomyocardial biopsy
>2000 NT-proBNP get a specialist assessment and echo w/in 6wks

## Management

- conservative
    - treat underlying cause
    - treat (low Hb, T4, infection, HTN) and avoid (drugs) exacerbating factors 
    - annual flu-vaccine, one-off pneumococcal
- medication
    - loop: symptoms + ?mortality benefit (+thiazide for support)
    - ACE-i/ARB: all pts, symptoms + mortality benefit
    - ARNI (sacubitril/valsartan): vasodilation, naturesis & diuresis, replaces ACE-i/ARb in NYHA II-III+, morbidity/mortality benefit
    - beta-blockers (cardioselective): mortality benefit in systolic only, start low and go slow once euvolaemic, beneficial in decompensation
    - MRA: mortality benefit, used in optimised symptomatic pts + post-MI w/ LVSD
    - vasodilators: hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate if intolerant ACEs/ARBs, reduces mortality (esp in black patients)
    - SGLT2i: mortality benefit
    - ivabradine: reduces hospitalisations
    - digoxin: reduces hospitalisations, rate/symptom control in pts w/ AF

HFpEF: contributing factors control, volume overload w/ diuretics, avoid bb

?uncontrolled but optimised: 
- minimal exertion (na & fluid restrict), metolazone & IV furosemide, opiates & nitrates for symptoms, weight + u+e, DVT prophylaxis
- cardiac rehab, assist device or transplant

palliation - treat/prevent comorbidities, nutrition, GP support, symptom & pain management
