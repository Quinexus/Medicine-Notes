# Hypertension

## Background
- ~50% of all vascular deaths 
- most RFs for premature death and CVD
- usually asymptomatic, so regularly screening is vital risk

- white-coat HTN
  - refers to elevated clinic pressure but normal ABPM
  - assoc w/ inc risk of CVD and all-cause mortality
  - lifestyle modifications should be instituted and home BP readings strongly encouraged to monitor for development of sustained HTN
- 'malignant' or accelerated phase HTN
  - rapid rise in BP -> vascular damage
  - pathological hallmark = fibrinoid necrosis
  - usually severe HTN (>200/120) + b/l retinal haemorrhages and exudates; papilloedema may/may not be present
  - symptoms are common
  - urgent treatment needed
  - precipitate AKI, HF, or encephalopathy which are HTN emergencies
  - untreated: 90% die in 1yr; treated: 70% survive 5yrs
  - more common in younger and black subjects
  - look for underlying cause
  

primary or 'essential' HTN: cause unknown ~95% of cases

secondary HTN
- ~5% cases
- consider if severe/resistant, abrupt rise, <30yrs of no RFs, presents w/ hypertensive emergency or assoc w/ electrolyte abnormalities
- kidney disease
  - most common secondary cause
  - 75% are from intrinsic kidney disease: glomerulonephritis, polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), systemic sclerosis, chronic pyelonephritis, or polycystic kidneys
  - 25% due to renovascular disease, most frequently atheromatous (rarely M cigarette smoker) or rarely fibromuscular dysplasia (young F)
- endocrine disease
  - cushing's
  - conn's
  - b/l adrenal hyperplasia
  - phaeochromocytoma
  - acromegaly
  - hyperparathyroidism
- others
  - coarctation
  - pregnancy
  - liquorice
  - drugs: steroids, MAOI, oral contraceptive pill, cocaine, amphetamines

## Presentation
- usually asypmtomatic (except malignant HTN)
- headache is no more common than in general population
- always examine CVS fully and check for retinopathy
- are there features of underlying cause, signs of renal disease, radiofemoral delay, or weak femoral pulses (coarctation), renal bruits, palpable kidneys, or Cushing's syndrome
- look for end-organ damage: LVH, retinopathy, and proteinuria - indicates severity and duration of HTN and associated w/ poorer prognosis


## Diagnosis
- guidelines thresholds differ
- general shift treat if >= 140/90 particularly if other CV RFs present
- don't rely on single reading - assess over period of time
- confirm w/ 24h ABPM or week of home readings

tests
- to confirm diagnosis: ABPM or home BP monitoring
- to help quantify overall risk: fasting glucose, cholesterol, eGFR
- to look for end-organ damage: ECG or echo (any LVH? past MI?); urinalysis (protein, blood)
- to 'exclude' secondary causes: U+E, Ca2+ (inc in hyperparathyroidism), plasma metnoradrenaline/adrenaline, renin & aldosterone
- special tests: CTA/MRA (renal artery stenosis), 24hr urinary free cortisol or overnight dexamethasone suppression test, MR aorta (coarctation)

grading hypertensive retinopathy
- I: tortuous arteries w/ thick shiny walls (silver or copper wiring)
- II: AV nipping (narrowing where arteries cross veins)
- III: flame haemorrhages and cotton-wool spots
- IV: papilloedema

measuring BP w/ sphygmomanometer
- use correct cuff size: cuff width should be >40% of arm circumferenec; bladder should be centred over brachial artery and cuff applied snugly; support arm in horizontal position at mid-sternal level
- inflate cuff while palpating brachial artery until pulse disappears; provides an estimate of systolic pressure
- inflate cuff until 30 above systolci pressure, then place stethoscope over brachial artery; deflate cuff at 2mmHg
- systolic pressure: appearance of sustained repetitive tapping sounds (Korotkoff I)
- diastolic pressure: usually disappearance of sounds (Korotkoff V)
  - however some individuals sounds present until zero point, in this case muffling of sounds Korotkoff IV should be used
  - state which is used for given reading
- for advice on using automated sphygmomanometers and list of validated devices

## Management
- who to treat
  - all w/ clinic BP >=140/90 (>=135/85 on 24h ABPM) 
  - or >=130/80 if <65yrs or CV RFs present
  - substantial benefit in treating over-80s
  - discuss individual pts and benefits of lowering BP <130/80, consider downstream benefits - likely dec dementia

- look for and treat underlying causes
- drug therapy reduces risk of CVD and death
- almost any adult over 50 would benefit from antihypertensives, whatever their starting BP
- essential HTN is not 'curable' and long-term is needed 
- emphasizes importance of compliance and regular home BP monitoring

treatment goal
- <140/90 
- reduce BP slowly
- rapid reduction can be fatal esp in context of acute stroke

lifestyle changes
- dec concomitant RFs
- stop smoking
- low-fat diet
- dec alcohol and salt intake
- inc exercise
- dec weight if obese

drugs
- monotherapy
  - 1st line: ACE-i, ARB, Ca2+-channel antagonist, and thiazide diuretics
  - ACE-i or ARB may be more effective in younger pts and have additional benefits w/ diabetes or CKD
  - conversely thiazides and Ca2+-channel antagonists favoured in older or black pts
  - beta-blocker are not 1st line for HTN but consider in pts w/ coexisting CAD, AF or stable HF
- combination Rx
  - ACE-i + thiazide or ACE-i + Ca2+-channel antagonist are sensible dual combinations followed by ACI-i + thiazide + Ca2+-channel antagonist
  - thiazides useful in obese pts
  - if BP uncontrolled on adequate doses of 3 drugs add a 4th conisder
    - spironolactone or amiloride but monitor U+E
    - alternatively beta-blocker or selectively beta-blocker and get help
  - check compliance (urinary drug screen, or observed Rx)
  - add statin if cholesterol raised
  - most drugs take 4-8wks to gain maximum effect: don't assess efficacy w/ 1 measurement

examples
- thiazides; SE: dec K+, dec Na+, impotence; CI: gout
- Ca2+ channel antagonists; SE: fatigue, gum hyperplasia, ankle oedema; DO NOT use short-acting form
- ACE-i: 1st choice if coexisting diabetes or proteinuria; SE: cough, inc K+, renal failure, angioedema; CI: b/l renal artery stenosis
- ARB: caution if valve disease or HCM; monitor K+; SE: vertigo, urticaria, pruritis; useful if ACE-i induces cough
- beta-blockers: SE: bronchospasm, HF, cold peripheries, lethargy, impotence; CI: asthma, caution in HF
