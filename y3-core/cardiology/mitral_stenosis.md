# Mitral Stenosis (MS)

## Background
- rheumatic fever
- congenital
- mucopolysaccharidoses
- endocardial fibroelastosis
- malignant carcinoid (rare)
- prosthetic valve

## Presentation
- normal mitral valve orifice are is ~4-6cm2, symptoms usually begin when orifice becomes <2cm2
- pulmonary HTN
  - dyspnoea
  - haemoptysis
  - chronic bronchitis-like picture
- pressure from large LA on local structures causes
  - hoarseness (recurrent laryngeal nerve)
  - dysphagia (oesophagus)
  - bronchial obstruction
- fatigue
- palps
- CP
- systemic emboli
- IE (rare)

signs
- malar flush on cheeks (due to dec cardiac output)
- low-volume pulse
- AF common (due to enlarged LA)
- tapping non-displaced apex beat (palpable S1)
- RV heave
- auscultation
  - loud S1
  - opening snap (pliable valve)
  - rumbling mid-diastoic murmur (best in expiration, pt on L side)
  - Graham Steell murmur may occur
- severity: more severe = longer diastolic murmur and closer opening snap to S2

## Diagnosis
- ECG
  - AF
  - p-mitrale
  - RVH
  - progressive RAD
- CXR
  - LA enlargement (double shadow in R cardiac silhouette)
  - pulmonary oedema
  - MV calcification
- echo diagnostic
  - significant stenosis exists if valve orifice is <1cm2/m2 body surface area
- cardiac cath indications
  - previous valvotomy
  - signs of other valve disease
  - angina
  - severe pulmonary HTN
  - calcified mitral valve

## Management
- if in AF: rate control is crucical
- anticoagulate w/ warfarin
- diuretics dec preload and pulmonary venous congestion
- if symptomatic w/ severe MS present
  - balloon valvuloplasty (if pliable, non-calcified valve)
  - open mitral valvotomy
  - valve replacement
