# Narrow Complex Tachycardias

## Background
ventricles depolarised via normal conduction pathways
arrythmia originates above or within the His bundle (ie supraventricular tachycardia (SVT))

- regular narrow complex tachycardias
- irregular 
  - normal variant: sinus dysrhythmias (rate changes w/ inspiration/expiration - regularly irregular); sinus rhythm w/ frequent ectopics
  - AF - no p-waves present
  - atrial flutter w/ variable block: atrial rhythm regular but ventricular rhythm (and pulse) irregular
  - multifocal atrial tachycardia
    - like focal atrial tachy but multiple groups of atrial cells taking it turns to initiate cardiac cycle
    - p-wave morphology and p-p intervals vary
    - usually associated w/ COPD

##Â Presentation

## Diagnosis
ECG: rate >100bpm, QRS <120ms; assess rhythm and p waves
    - if p waves - check atrial rate, p-wave morphology, relationship between atrial and ventricular rates, position of p wave in cardiac cycle (short vs long RP interval)

## Management
- if compromised -> DC cardiovert!
- ID and treat underlying rhythm
  - sinus tachy 2nd-ary to volume depletion -> IV fluids
  - multifocal sinus tachy 2nd-ary to COPD -> hypoxia and hypercapnia
  - focal atrial tachycardia 2nd-ary to digoxin -> digoxin-specific Ab fragments
  - AVRT 2nd-ary to WPW -> flecanide, propafenone, or amiodarone
  - AF and atrial flutter
- AVNRT or AVRT
  - consider transiently blocking the AVN
  - should break the circuit of an atrioventricular re-entry rhythm, allowing sinus rhythm to re-establish
  - if underlying rhythm is actually atrial in origin, AVN blockade will not treat the rhythm but paused ventricular activity will unmask the atrial rhythm aiding diagnosis and management
- AVN blockade
  1. vagal manoeuvres
     1. carotid sinus massage
     2. valsalva manoeuvre
  2. IV adenosine
- some cases cause sympatomatic episodes of sufficient severity and frequency to warrant more invasive treatment eg ablation therapy for accessory pathways
