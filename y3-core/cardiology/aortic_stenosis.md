# Aortic Stenosis

aortic sclerosis: senile degeneration of valve; ejection systolic murmur, but no carotid radiation and normal pulse (character and volume) and S2

##Â Background
- senile calcification commonest
- others
  - congenital (bicuspid valve, Williams syndrome)
  - rheumatic heart disease

## Presentation
elderly person w/ CP, exertional dyspnoea, or syncope

- classic triad
  - angina
  - syncope
  - HF
- also
  - dyspnoea
  - dizziness
  - syncope
  - systemic emboli if IE
  - sudden death

signs
- slow rising pulse w/ narrow pulse pressure (feel for diminished and delayed carotid upstroke - parvus et tardus)
- heaving, non-displaced apex beat
- LV heave
- aortic thrill
- ejection systolic murmur (heard at base, L sternal edge and aortic area, radiates to carotids)
- SI usually normal
- as stenosis worsens - A2 increasingly delayed, giving first a single S2 and then reversed splitting - sign is rare
- more common - quiet A2; severe AS - A2 may be inaudible (calcified valve)
- may be ejection click (pliable valve) or an S4


## Diagnosis
- ECG
  - LVH w/ strain pattern
  - p-mitrale
  - LAD
  - poor R-wave progression
  - LBBB
  - complete AV block (calcified ring)
- CXR
  - LVH
  - calcified aortic valve
  - post-stenotic dilatation of ascending aortic
- echo
  - diagnostic
  - doppler echo can estimate gradient across valves
    - severe stenosis 
      - peak gradient >~40 mmHg (but beware the poor LV not able to generate gradient - 'low flow, low gradient' severe AS)
      - valve are <1cm2
    - if aortic jet velocity >4m/s (or increasing by >0.3m/s per year) riks of complications is increased
- cardiac catheter
  - can assess: valve gradient, LV function, CAD
  - risks: emboli generation
- CT aortogram if bicuspid aotic valve to look for coarctation or root dilatation (BAV aortopathy)

differential diagnosis: HCM, aortic sclerosis

## Management

- if symptomatic, prognosis poor w/o surgery
  - 2-3yr survival if angina/syncope
  - 1-2yrs if cardiac failure
- if moderate-to-severe and treated medically, mortality can be high as 50% at 2 yrs, therefore prompt valve replacement is usually recommended if symptomatic, dec LVEF, or if undergoing other cardiac surgery
- if pt not medically fit for surgery, transcatheter aortic valve implatation (TAVI) may be attempted
