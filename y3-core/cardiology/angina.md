# Angina Pectoris
symptomatic reversible myocaridal ischaemia


## Background
pathophysiology:
- atherosclerosis affecting coronary arteries, narrowing lumn and reducing flow to myocardium
- high demand (eg exercise) - insufficient supply

- other precipitants: emotion, cold weather, and heavy meals
- causes: atheroma, rarely - anaemia; cornary artery spasms; AS; tachyarrhythmia; HCM; arteritis/small vessel disease (microvascular angina/cardiac syndrome x)

types
- stable angina: induced by effort, relieved by rest/nitrates
- unstable angina (crescendo angina): angina of increasing frequency or severity; occurs on minimal exertion or at rest; associated w/ inc risk of MI; type of ACS
- decubitus angina: precipitated by lying flat
- variant (prinzmetal)/vasospastic angina: caused by coronary artery spasm

## Presentation
1. constricting/heavy discomfort to the chest, jaw, neck, shoulders, or arms
2. symptoms brought on by exertion
3. symptoms relieved within 5min by rest or glyceryl trinitrate

all 3 features = typical
2 features = atypical
0-1 features = non-anginal CP

associated symptoms: dyspnoea, nausea, sweatiness, faintness
features that make angina less likely
    - pain that is continuous
    - pleuritic
    - worse on swallowing
    - pain associated w/ palpitations, dizziness, or tingling

## Diagnosis
- ECG: usually normal, may show ST depression; flat or inverted T waves; signs of past MI
- bloods: FBC (anaemia), U+E (needed before ACEi and other meds), TFTs (hypo/hyper), LFTs (before statins), lipids, HbA1c
- consider echo and CXR

- cardiac stress testing: exercise or meds (dobutamine) -> ECG, echo, MRI, perfusion scan (nuclear)
- CT coronary angio
- invasive coronary angio in cath lab via brachial/femoral -> aorta -> coronary arteries using XRays + contrast (gold standard)

further investigations
- for IHD
    - exercise ECG: assess for ischaemic changes
    - angiography: caridac CT w/ contrast, or transcatheter angiography
    - functional imaging: myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, stress echo (echo during exercise or dobutamine), cardiac MRI
- for typical angina in previous IHD
    - treat as stable angina
    - non-invasive testing to confirm
    - offer non-invasive function testing if uncertain if CP is caused by myocardial ischaemia
- for typical and atypical angina
    - CT angio -> functional imaging as 2nd line -> transcatheter angiography 3rd line
- non-anginal CP
    - ?ischaemic changes on 12-lead ECG
    - Y: investigate as per typical and atypical angina
    - N: further investigations for IHD (unless high clinical ?IHD for other reasons - discuss w/ specialist); ensure alternative CP diagnosis adequately explored
- further investigations: typical angina but few RFs for IHD -> lf precipitating or exacerbating factors eg severe anaemia or cardiomyopathy
- if anginal symptoms not adequately controlled w/ optimal medical therapy: offer transcatheter angiography; additional non-invasive or invasive functional testing may be required to evaluate angiographic findings and guide Rx decisions

## Management
- address exacerbating factors: anaemia, tachycardia, thyrotoxicosis
- secondary prevention
    - stop smoking, exercise, dietary advice, optimise HTN and diabetes control
    - 75mg aspirin daily if not contraindicated
    - address hyperlipidaemia
    - consider ACE-i, esp if HTN or DM

prn symptoms relief: GTN spray or sublingual tabs
    - repeat dose if pain not gone after 5 mins
    - call ambulance if pain still present 5 min after second dose
    - SE: headaches, dec BP

anti-anginal medications: 1st BB and/or CCB (do not combine BB w/ non-dihydropyridine); if failed control, trial other agents
    - BB
    - calcium antagonist
    - long-acting nitrates eg ISMN, alternatives: GTN skin patches
    - ranolazine: inhibits late Na current, caution if HF, elderly, weight <60k or prolonged QT
    - ivabradine: reduces HR w/ minimal impact on BP; pt must be sinus, only consider if clinical HF also present
    - nicorandil: K+ channel activator; CI: acute pulmonary oedema, severe hypotension, hypovolaemia, LV failure

revascularisation: consider when optimal medical therapy proves inadequate or if likely to derive survival benefit
- PCI
    - balloon inflated inside stenosed vessel to open lumen; stent inserted to reduce risk of re-stenosis
    - DAPT recommended for at least 12 months after stent insertion to reduce risk of in-stent thrombosis
    - seek specialist advice regarding antiplatelets if pt has high bleeding risk or requires surgery
- CABG
    - pts undergoing CABG less likely to need repeat revascularisation and those w/ multivessel disease can expect better outcomes
    - recovery is slower
    - midline sternotomy incision
    - graft from: saphenous vein (inner leg), internal thoracic artery, or radial artery

PCI vs CABG: PCI faster recovery, lower stroke rates, higher rates of needing repeat revasc

# Revision!

##Â Mneumonics
RAMPS (5 principals of management):
- Refer to cardiology
- Advise about diagnosis, management, and when to call ambulance
- Medical treatment
- Procedural/surgical interventions
- Secondary prevention

Secondary prevention 4As:
- Aspirin
- Atorvastatin
- ACE-inhibitor (DM, HTN, CKD or HF)
- Already on aa for symptoms
