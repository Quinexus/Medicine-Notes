# Atrial Fibrillation

##Â Background
- chaotic, irregular atrial rhythm at 300-600bpm
- AV node responds intermittently -> irregular ventricular rhythm
- cardiac output drops by 10-20% as ventricles aren't primed reliably by atria
- AF common in elderly (<=9%)
- main risk of embolic stroke
  - warfarin reduces 1%/yr from 4%
  - ECG on everyone w/ irregular pulse (opportunistic screening recommended if >65yr)
- if AF started more than 48h ago, intracardiac clots may have formed -> anticoagulation before cardioversion

causes
- HTN
- IHD (seen in 22% of MI pts)
- PE
- mitral valve disease
- HF
- pneumonia
- hyperthyroidism
- caffeine
- alcohol
- post-op
- dec K+
- dec Mg2+

types
- paroxysmal AF (PAF): intermittent
- persistent AF: fails to self-terminate in 7d
- long-standing persistent AF: lasts >12mths
- permanent AF: decision made to pursue rhythm control strategy
- 'lone' AF: this means no cause found

pre-excited
- accessory pathways capable of conducting at rapid rates (eg sometimes in WPW syndrome) pass erratic electrical activity from atria to ventricles, unfiltered by AVN
- ECGs will show irregular, broad QRS complexes at >200bpm
- high risk of VT and VF

## Presentation
symptoms: may be asymptomatic or cause CP, palpitations, dyspnoea, or faintness

signs
- irregularly irregular pulse
  - apical pulse rate > radial rate
  - 1st heart sound = variable intensity
- signs of LVF
- examine whole pt: AF often associated w/ non-cardiac disease

## Diagnosis
- ECG: shows absent P waves, irregular QRS complexes
- Blood tests: U+E, cardiac enzymes, TFTs
- Echo: L atrial enlargement, mitral valve disease, poor LV function, and other structural abnormalities
- ambulatory ECG may help diagnose PAF or assess AF burden

## Management
managing acute AF
- if pt has adverse signs: shock, MI (CP or ECG changes), syncope, HF
  - ABCDE, get senior input
  - DC cardioversion (synchronised shock, start 120-150) +/- amiodarone if unsuccessful
  - do not delay treatment in order to start anticoagulation
- if pt is stable & AF started <48h
  - rate/rhythm control may be tried
  - rhythm control: DC cardiovert or give flecainide (CI: structural heart disease, IHD) or amiodarone
  - start heparin if cardioversion is delayed
- if pt is stable & AF started >48h or unclear time of onset
  - rate control
  - if rhythm control chosen: pt must be anticoagulated for >3wks first
- correct electrolyte imbalances (K+, Mg2+, Ca2+)
  - Rx associated illness and consider anticoagulation

managing chronic AF
- main goals rate control and anticoagulate
- rate control is at least as good as rhythm control 
- rhythm control may be appropriate if
  - symptomatic or CCF
  - younger
  - presenting for 1st time w/ lone AF
  - AF from corrected precipitant

rate control
- beta-blocker or rate-limiting Ca2+ blocker are 1st choice
- avoid Ca2+ blocker if LVEF <40%
- if fails -> add digoxin -> consider amiodarone
- digoxin monotherapy in chronic AF only acceptable in sedentary pts
- do not give beta-blockers w/ verapamil
- aim for HR <110 at rest

rhythm control
- elective DC cardioversion
  - do echo to check for intracardiac thrombi
  - if inc risk cardioversion failure (past failure or past recurrance) give amiodarone for 4 wks before the procedure and 12mnths after
- elective pharmacological cardioversion
  - flecainide 1st choice (CI if structural heart disease, eg scar tissue from MI: use IV amiodarone instead)
  - in refractory cases: AVN ablation w/ pacing, pulmonary vein ablation, or maze procedure may be considered

paroxysmal AF
- 'pill in pocket' (eg flecainide or proafenone PRN) may be tried if
  - infrequent AF
  - BP >100 systolic
  - no past LV dysfunction
- anticoagulate
- consider ablation if symptomatic

atrial flutter
- similar to AF regarding rate/rhythm control and need for anticoagulation
- DC-CV preferred to pharmacological cardioversion
- IV amiodarone may be needed if rate control is proving difficult
- recurrence rates are high so ablation often recommended for long-term management

anticoagulation
- acute AF
  - use heparing until full risk assessment for emboli is made
  - if >48h ensure >=3wks of therapeutic anticoagulation before elective cardioversion + 4wks afterwards (in pts w/o long-term need for anticoagulation)
  - NB: transoesophageal-guided cardioversion option if urgent CV required
  - use DOAC or warfarin (target INR 2-3) if high risk of emboli 
    - past ischaemic stroke, TIA, or emboli
    - >=75yrs w/ inc BP, DM
    - CAD/PAD
    - evidence of valve disease or dec LV function/CCF only do echo if unsure
  - use no anticoagulation if stable sinus rhythm has been restored, no risk factors for emboli and AF recurrence unlikely (ie no failed cardioversions, no structural heart disease, no previous recurrence, no sustained AF for >1yr)

- chronic AF
  - assess need w/ CHA2DS2-VASc score to assess embolic stroke risk
    - consider anticoagulation if score M>0, F>1
    - balancing against risks of anticoagulation to pt assessed w/ HAS-BLED score
  - long-term anticoagulation should be w/ DOAC or warfarin
    - DOACs preferentially used except in case of mechanical heart valves or moderate-severe mitral stenosis where warfarin is anticoagulant of choice
  - when anticoagulation is contraindicated due to high bleeding risk consider left atrial appendage occlusion device

CHA2DS2-VASc
- Congestive cardiac failure (1 point)
- Hypertension (1)
- Age 65-74yrs (1)
- Age >74yrs (2)
- Diabetes (1)
- previous Stroke/TIA/thromboembolism (2)
- Vascular disease (1)
- Sex Category (1 if female)
- score of 2 = annual stroke risk of 2.2%

HAS-BLED - 1 point for each of:
- label INR
- age >65

- alcohol abuse
- uncontrolled HTN
- history of, or predisposition to, major bleeding
- renal disease
