# Mitral Regurgitation

backflow through mitral valve during systole

## Background
- acute
  - papillary muscle dysfunction/rupture (eg post-MI, trauma)
  - ruptured chordae tendineae due to mitral valve prolapse (MVP)
  - infective endocarditis
  - rheumatic fever
- chronic
  - functional (LV dilatation)
  - annular calcification (elderly)
  - connective tissue disorders (Ehlers-Danlos, Marfan's)
  - cardiomyopathy
  - MVP
  - congenital (may be assoc w/ other defects)
  - appetite suppressants (eg fenfluramine, phentermine)

## Presentations
symptoms
- dyspnoea
- fatigue
- palpitations
- symptoms of causative factor (eg fever)
signs
- AF
- displaced hyperdynamic apex
- pansystolic murmur at apex radiating to axilla
- soft S1
- split S2
- loud P2 (pulmonary HTN)
- severy: more severe, larger the LV

## Diagnosis
ECG
- AF
- P-mitrale if SR (may mean inc LA size)
- LVH

CXR
- big LA & LV
- mitral calcification
- pulmonary oedema

echo
- assess LV function & MR severity and aetiology (TOE assess severity and suitability for repair than replacement)
- cardiac cath to confirm diagnosis, exclude other valve disease and assess CAD (can combine w/ CABG w/ valve surgery)

##Â Management
- rate control if fast AF
- anticoagulate if
  - AF
  - history of embolism
  - prosthetic valve
  - additional MS
- diuretics for symptoms
- surgery 
  - if symptomatic w/ severe MR or asymptomatic w/ severe MR and dec LVEF
  - aim to repair or replace valve before LV irreversibly impaired
  - if prohibitive surgical risk and favourable anatomy consider transcatheter MV repair (MitraClip device)
