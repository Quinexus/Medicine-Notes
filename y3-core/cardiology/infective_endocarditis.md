# Infective Endocarditis
fever + new murmur = endocarditis until proven otherwise
fever >1 wk in those at risk -> blood cultures

## Background
- acute IE tends to occur on 'normal' valves and may present w/ acute HF +/- emboli
- commonest organism: Staph aureus
- RFs
  - skin breaches (dermatitis, IV lines, wounds)
  - haemodialysis
  - immunosuppression
  - DM
- mortality: 5-50% (related to age and embolic events)

- endocarditis on abnormal valve tends to run a subacute course
- RFs: 
  - aortic/mitral valve disease
  - tricuspid in IVDU
  - coarctation, PDA, VSD
  - prosthetic valves
- endocarditis on prosthetic valves
  - early: w/in 60d of surgery; Staph aureus/epidermidis; poor prognosis
  - late

causes
- bacteria
  - staph aureus commonest (usually subacute) followed by oral viridians group strep, non-oral step incl strep bovis (colonoscopy ?tumour), enterococci, and coxiella burnetii
  - rarely: HACEK gram -ve (Haemophilis, Aggregatibacter, Cardiovacterium, Eikenella, Kingella); diptheroids; Chlamydia
- fungi
  - candida, aspergillus, histoplasma
  - usually IVDU, immunocompromised or prosthetic valves
  - high mortality need surgery
- other: SLE (libman-sacks), malignancy

## Presentation
- septic signs: fever, rigors, night sweats, malaise, weight loss, anaemia, splenomegaly, and clubbing
- cardiac lesions
  - new murmur or pre-existing murmur
  - vegtations -> valve destruction, severe regurgitation, or valve obstruction
  - aortic root abscess -> prolongation of PR interval -> complete AV block
  - LVF common cause of death
- immune complex deposition: vasculitis
  - microscopy haematuria common; GN and AKI may occur
  - roth spot: boat-shaped retinal haemorrhage w/ pale centre
  - splinter haemorrhage
  - osler's nodes: painful pulp infarcts in fingers or toes
- embolic phenomena
  - abscess in relevant organ
  - in skin: janeway lesions = painless palmar or plantar macules
  - janeway + osler = pathgnomonic
- other changes in longstanding disease
  - splenomegaly
  - finger clubbing

## Diagnosis

modified duke criteria
- major criteria
  - positive blood culture
    - typical organism in 2 separate cultures or
    - persistently +ve blood cultures eg 3 >12h apart (or majority if >3) or
    - single +ve blooc culture for Coxiella burnetii or phase I IgG antibody titre >1:800
  - endocardium involved
    - +ve echo (vegetation, abscess, new valvular regurgitation, dehiscence of prosthetic valve) or
    - abnormal activity around prosthetic vlave on PET/CT or SPECT/CT or
    - paravalvular lesions on cardiac CT
- minor criteria
  - predisposition (cardiac lesion; IVDU)
  - fever <38
  - vascular phenomena (major arterial emboli, spetic pulmonary infarcts, Janeway lesions, etc)
  - immunological phenomena (GN, Osler's nodes, etc)
  - +ve blood culture that does not meet major criteria
how to diagnose: 2 major or 1 major and 3 minor or all 5 minors

- blood cultures: 3 sets at different times from different sites at peak of fever; 85-90% diagnosed from 1st two sets, 10% culture negative
- blood tests: normochronic, normocytic anaemia, neutrophilia, high ESR/CRP; RF+ve; also check U+E, Mg2+, LFT
- urinalysis: microscopic haematuria
- CXR: cardiomegaly, pulmonary oedema
- regular ECGs: check heart block
- echo: 
  - TTE may show vegetations, but only if >2mm
  - TOE more sensitive, better for visualising mitral lesions and possible development of aoritc root abscess
- CT
  - look for emboli
  - cardiac ct and fdg pet/ct emerging imaging to see complications, extra-cardiac sites of infection and setting of non-diagnostic toe

## Management
- liase early w/ microbiologists and cardiologists
- antibiotics
  - blind therapy - native/prosthetic >1yr: ampi, fluclox, and gent; vanc + gent if pen allergic; if ?gram -ve meropenem + vanc
  - blind therapy - prosthetic: vanc + gent + rifampicin
  - staphs - native: fluclox for >4wks; if pen-allergic/MRSA: vanc + rifampicin + gent
  - staph - prosthetic: fluclox + rifampicin + gent for 6wks (review need after 2wks); if pen-allergic or MRSA: vanc + rifampicin + gent
  - streps - pen-sensitive: benpen
  - streps - less sensitive: benpen + gent; if pen-allergic or highly pen-resistant: vanc + gent
  - enterococci: amox + gent; if pen-allergic: vanc + gent for 4wks (6wks prosthetic valve); review need for gent after 2wks
  - HACEK: ceft for 4wks w/ native valve or 6 wks w/ prosthetic
  - fungal: candida - amphotericin, aspergillus - voriconazole
- surgery for: HF valve pathology, large vegetations/abscesses, unresponsive to Abx

prognosis: 50% need surgery; 20% in-hospital mortality (staphs 30%, bowel bacterial 14%, streps 6%); 15% recurrence at 2 years

complication
- high mortality rate
- heart valve damage -> regurg
- HF
- infective/non-infective emboli (causing abscesses, strokes, splenic infarction)
- glomerulonephritis -> renal impairment

prevention - Abx prophylaxis
- recommended for those at risk of IE undergoing invasive procedures = 
  - prosthetic valves
  - previous vlave repair (with prosthetic use)
  - history of previous IE
  - cyanotic congenital heart defects
  - pts for first 6mnths after surgical or percutaneous repair of congenital heart defects w/ prosthetic material (indefinitely in case of residual shunt or valvular regurgitation)
- routine prophylaxis for low-risk individuals not indicated
