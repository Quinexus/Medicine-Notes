# Multiple Sclerosis
inflammatory plaques of demyelination in CNS disseminated in space and time

## Background
- demyelination heals poorly -> axonal loss
- >80% progressive disability
- exact cause unknown, likely combination of genetic and environmental factors
  - >30% concordance in identical twins
  - increasing incidence w/ lattitude in some parts of work
- hypothesis: vitamin D and infection
- mean age of onset = 30yrs F:M>=3:1

## Presentation
usually monosymptomatic
- ~20% present w/ unilateral optic neuritis (pain on eye movement and dec rapid central vision)
- corticospinal tract and bladder involvement common
- symptoms worsen w/ heat

- sensory
  - dyaesthesia
  - pins and needles
  - dec vibration sense
  - trigeminal neuralgia
- GI: swallowing disorders, constipation
- eye: diplopia, hemianopia, optic neuritis, visual phenomena, bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia, pupil defects
- motor
  - spastic weakness
  - myelitis
- cerebellum: trunk and limb ataxia, intention tremor, scanning speech, falls
- sexual/GU
  - erectile dysfunction
  - anorgasmia
  - urine retention
  - incontinence
- congnitive/visuospatial decline: causes unemployment, accidents, amnesia, dec mood, dec executive functioning

progression
- most relapsing-remitting, intial recovery in between relapses
- w/ time remission becomes incomplete, so disability accumulates (secondary progression)
- 10% steadily progressive disability in absence of relapses (primary progressive)
- minority experience no progressive disablement at all
- poor prognostic signs: older M; motor signs at onset; many early relapses; many MRI lesions; axonal loss
- pregnancy
  - does not alter rate of progression
  - relapses reduce during pregnancy and increase 3-6mnths afterwards but return to previous rate afterwards

## Diagnosis

- clinical by consultant neurologist using established criteria and after alternative diagnoses have been excluded
- early diagnosis and treatment reduce relapse rates and disability

- tests: extra supporting information
  - MRI: sensitive but not specific for plaque detection; may also exclude other causes
  - CSF oligoclonal bands of IgG on electrophoresis not in serum: CNS inflammation
  - delayed visual, auditory, and somatosensory evoked potentials

McDonald criteria (what additional evidence needed for given clinical presentation)
- >= 2 attacks (relapses) w/ >=2 objective clinical lesions: none
- >= 2 attacks w/ 1 objective clinical lesion: MRI - spatially disseminated lesions or 2nd attack at a new site
- 1 attack w/ >=2 objective clinical lesions: dissemination in time - new lesion on repeat MRI after >3mnths or 2nd attack or +ve CSF
- 1 attack w/ 1 objective clinical lesion (monosymptomatic presentation): dissemination in space - MRI or +ve CSF if >=2 MRI lesions w/ MS and dissemination in time (by MRI or a 2nd clinical attack)
- insidious neurological progression suggestive of primary progressive MS: continued progression for >=1yr + 2 of MRI - characteristic brain lesion & MRI: 2 or more cord lesions, +ve CSF

careful history can reveal past history episodes
attacks must last >1h w/ >30d between attacks

eponymous names
- devic's syndrome (= neuromyelitis optica): no longer MS; transverse myelitis, optic atrophy, and anti-aquaporin 4 antibodies
- lhermitte's sign: neck flexion causes 'electric shocks' in trunks/limbs (also +ve in cervical spondylosis, cord tumours, and dec B12)
- uhthoff's phenomenon: worsening of symptoms w/ heat
- charles bonnet syndrome (rare): dec acuity/temporary blindness +/- complex visual hallucinations
- pulfrich effect: unequal eye latencies, causing disorientation in traffic as straight trajectories seem curved and distances are misjudged on looking sideways
- argyll robertson pupil

## Management
requires MDT and full pt involvement

- lifestyle advice: regular exercise, stopping smoking and avoiding stress may help
- DMARDs
  - offered to all pts w/ relapsing-remitting MS
  - 1st line: interferon-beta, glatiramer, oral dimethyl fumarate, diroximel fumarate, ozanimod or fingolimod for mild/moderate disease
  - ocrelizumab (B cells), alemtuzumab (T cells), natalizumab (alpha4 integrin subunit that allows immune cells to cross BBB) are approved but reserved for more aggressive cases
- treating relapses
  - 1st rule out infection: transiently worsen symptoms
  - methylpred for 3-5d shortens acute relapses, use sparingly (<2x/yr)
  - does not alter overall prognosis

symptom control
- spasticity: baclofen/gabapentin; 2nd line tizanidine or dantrolene; if these fail -> BDZ
- tremor: botox type A injections improve arm tremor and functioning
- urgency/frequence
  - if post-micturition residual urine >100mL, teach intermittent self-catherisation
  - if <100mL try tolterodine
- fatigue: amatadine, modafinil, SSRIs, CBT and exercise
