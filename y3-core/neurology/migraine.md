# Migraine

## Background
15%; M:F = 1:3

partial triggers (50%): CHOCOLATE
- Chocolate
- Hangovers
- Orgasms
- Cheese/Caffeine
- Oral contraceptives
- Lie-ins
- Alcohol
- Travel
- Exercise

## Presentation
symptoms
- prodrome: hours/days before, present in majority = tiredness, yawning, mood/concentration changes
- aura: reversible neurological in 1/3, usually gradual onset, resolves in hour; usually precedes headache but may accompany it
  - visual: chaotic distorting, 'melting' and jumbling of lines, dots, zigzags, scotomata or hemianopia
  - somatosensory: paraesthesia spreading from fingers to face
  - motor: dyarthria and ataxia (migraine w/ brainstem aura), opthalmoplegia or hemiparesis (hemiplegia migraine is rare; misdiagnosed TIA/stroke is much more commmon)
  - speech: (8% of auras) dysphasia or paraphasia
  - isolated aura w/ no headache can occur
- migraine headache
  - unilateral, throbbing headache, typically aggrevated by head movement or physical activity
  - median duration 24h
  - accompanying neck pain, N&V +/- photophobia/phonophobia is common
  - may be allodynia
- postdrome: occurs in 80%, symptoms similar to those listed in prodrome, usually lasting <12h

## Diagnosis
clinical

criteria if no aura
- >=5 headaches lasting 4-72h + N/V (or photo/phono) + any 2 of:
- unilateral
- pulsating
- imapairs (or worsened by) routine activity
  
differentials: cluster/tension headaches, cervical spondylosis, inc BP, intracranial pathology, sinusitis/otitis media, dental caries; TIAs may mimic migraine aura

## Management

acute
(if not adequate can lead to chronic)
- triptans +/- NSAIDs/paracetamol (stroke risk not clear)
- rescue therapy in ED presentations eg metoclopramide
  
preventative: can achieve dec ~50% in attack freq in most pts; consider after risks and benefits discussion
- non-pharmcological: avoid triggers (headache diary) and ensure analgesic rebound headache, transcutaneous nerve stimulation may help
- medications
  - 1st line: propranolol or topiramate; amitriptyline can be used off licence
  - if on previously recommended prophylatic agents (eg valproate, verapamil, pizotifen, pregabalin or ACE-i/ARB) and good control, continue as required
  - CGRP antagonists approved for pts at least 4 headaches days/month who cannot tolerate or who have not achieved control w/ 2-3 previous preventative treatments
  - 12-weekly BOTOX type A injections a last resort in chronic migraine

### Consideration in females
contraception and migrains
- incidence of migraine (esp w/ aura) + ischaemic stroke increased by use of combined OCP
- use of progesterone-only or non-hormonal contraception in migraine + aura
- low-dose combined OCP can be used in those without aura
- warn pts to stop OCP if aura or worsening migraine

perimentrual migraine: consider NSAIDs or triptans on days migraine is expected

pregnancy
- migraine often improves if not get help
- worsening headaches could mean inc risk pre-eclampsia and CV complications
- paracetamol 1st line
- triptans and NSAIDs but assess risk/benefit w/ pts first
- don't use aspirin when breastfeeding
- anti-emetic: metoclopramide (upto 5 days only) or promethazine
- prophylaxis: seek specialist advice
