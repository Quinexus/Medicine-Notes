# Alzheimer's Disease

## Background
cause
- environmental + genetic
- accumulation of beta-amyloid peptide, a degradation product of APP -> progressive neuronal damage, neurofibrillary tangles, inc number of amyloid plaques, and loss of NT ACh
- neuronal loss is selective - hippocampus, amygdala, temporal neocortex, and subcortical nuclei and most vulnerable
- vascular effects are also important - 95% of AD pts show evidence of vascular dementia

RFs
- 1st degree relative w/ AD
- Down's syndrome (AD is inevitable, often <40yrs)
- homozygosity for apolipoprotein E (APOE) E4 allele
- PICALM, CL1, & CLU variants
- vascular RFs
- dec physical/cognitive activity
- depression
- loneliness (inc risk ~ 2; simply living alone is not a RF)
- smoking

## Presentation
- anosognosia - lack of insight into problems engendered by disease
- later irritability, mood disturbance (depression or euphoria), behavioural change, psychosis, agnosia (may not recognise self in mirror)
- no standard natural history
- cognitive impairment is progressive, but non-cognitive may come and go over months
- eventually many pts become sedentary, taking little interest in anything

## Diagnosis
? in >40yrs w/ persistent, progressive, and global cognitive impairment: visuospatial skill, memory, verbal abilities, and executive function are all affected, unlike other dementias which affect certain domains but not others 

## Management
- refer to specialist memory service
- acetylcholinesterase inhibitors 
- BP control (in HF there is a 2~ inc risk of AD; extra risk halves w/ BP control)

- prevention in context of AD's time course
- changes in CSF
- beta-amyloid are seen ~25yrs before onset of unequivocal symptoms (USY) and deposition detected 15yrs before USY
- CSF tau protein and brain atrophy detected 15yrs before USY
- cerebral hypometabolism and impaired episodic memory occur 10yrs before USY
- global cognitive impairment occurs 5yrs before USY
- prevention will probably be most effective before any of this starts - insufficient evidence to recommend any specific interventions
- no relationship between brain structure, neurofibrillary tangles, and function


overlap between lewy body dementia, AD, and parkinson's, complicating treatment decisions: levodopa can precipitate delusions, and antipsychotic drugs worsen PD. Rivastigmine may help all three

- acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors
  - donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine are all modestly effective in treating AD and are recommended by NICE
  - though noneshould be used in mild disease and they should be discontinued if no worthwhile effect on symptoms
  - donepezil
  - rivastigmine
  - galantamine
  - cholinergic effects of acetylchoolinesterase inhibitors may exacerbate peptic ulcer disease and heart block; ask symptoms and do ECG first
- antiglutamatergic treatment
  - memantine (NMDA antagonist) reasonably effective in late-stage AD
  - recommended in pts w/ severe disease or those w/ moderate disease in which AChE inhibtors are not tolerated/CI
  - SE: hallucinations, confusion, hypertonia, hypersexuality
- amyloid-beta monoclonal antibodies
  - aducanumab (monthly IV infusion) was promising development controversially approved by US FDAm but refused in Europe weak supportive evidence in mild PET-confirmed AD
  - more promising evidence for lecanemab but both associated w/ amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (oedema or haemorrhage)
- antipsychotics
  - consider in severe, non-cognitive symptoms only
  - possible inc risk stroke/TIA - discuss risks and cerebrovascular RFs,
  - avoid in mild-to-moderate: lewy body dementia (risk of neuroleptic sensitivity reactions), AD, and vascular dementia
- vitamin supplementation
  - trials of dietary and vitamin supplements - mixed and disappointing
  - best evidence for vitamin E which may confer modest benefit in delaying functional progression in mild-to-moderate AD, but with no effect on cognitive performance

prognosis: mean survival  = 7yrs from USY
