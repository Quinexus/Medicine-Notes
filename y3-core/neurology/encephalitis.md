# Encephalitis

- inflammation of the brain
- leads to brain dysfunction (encephalopathy) w/ evidence of inflammation measured in CSF, or using imaging or EEG
- can result in severe disability/death
- ? if neurological Sx or change in behaviour preceded by infectious prodrome (inc To, rash, lymphadenopathy, cold sore, conjunctivitis)
- ?, treat before exact cause known: HSV encephalitis can kill rapidly and needs urgent antivirals

## Background
- encephalopathy
  - altered consciousness >24h inc lethargy and change in behaviour
  - ddx is wide and inc encephalitis, sepsis, hypoglycaemia, hepatic encephalopathy, DKA, drugs, hypoxic brain injury, urameia, SLE, vasculitis, Wernicke's (? -> vit B1), glioma (mimics CNS inflammation), mets
- encepalitis
  - encephalopathy + evidence of CNS inflammation = fever, seizures, focal neurology, CSF findings, EEG, neuroimaging

causes
- viral: HSV-1&2, VZV, adenovirus, CMV, HIV, measles, mumps, rabies, arboviruses, Japanese B encephalitis, West Nile virus, tick-borne encephalitis
- non-viral infections: any bacterial meningitis, TB, malaria, listeria, Lyme disease, legionella, leptospirosis, aspergillosis, cryptococcus, schistosomiasis, typhus
- auto-immune (w/ tumour associations): anti-NMDA receptor (ovarian teratoma), anti-LGI-1 (thymoma), anti-Hu (small cell lung), anti-Ma (testicular tumour), anti-GAD, acute disseminated, Bickerstaff's encephalitis

ask about travel history and RFs for immunocompromise

## Presentation
- confusion, change in personality, drowsiness
- seizures (may be subtle)
- fever
- headache
- focal neurological signs
- dec GCS or coma

## Diagnosis
- LP
  - imaging not needed prior if no focal neurological signs, no papilloedema, no seizures, and GCS >12
  - moderate inc CSF protein, inc lymphocytes, glucose often normal
  - viral PCR inc HSV (high sensitivity and specificity, though may be negative early in disease course so consider repeat)
  - do not delay treatment if ?encephalitis and LP delayed; CSF will remain PCR positive for few days so can be done after treatment is given
- bloods: HIV, blood culture, serum for viral PCR, throat swab, toxoplasma IgM titre, malaria film, consider autoantibody testing
- MRI: abnormal in 90% of HSV encephalitis, normal or subtle abnormalities in autoimmmune encephalitis
- CT, CT-PET: if ?paraneoplastic cause
- EEG: diffuse abnormalities are non-specific and can be abnormal in encephalopathy due to other causes

## Management
- mortality in untreated is >70%
- aciclovir for 14d, consider repeat CSF HSV PCR at 14 days to confirm discontinuation, may need longer if immunosuppressed
  - supportive therapy in HDU or critical care may be needed
  - monitory kidney function w/ IV aciclovir (small risk of crystal nephropathy)
  - CMV encephalitis: ganciclovir, foscarnet
  - toxoplasmosis
- symptomatic treatment
