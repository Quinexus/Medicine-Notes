# Subdural Haematoma

## Background
pathophysiology
- bleeding is from bridging veins between cortex and venous sinuses (vulnerable to deceleration injuring) -> haematoma between dura and arachnoid
- gradually raises ICP & shifting midline structures away from side of clot and, if untreated -> eventual tentorial herniation and coning

aetiology
- trauma: but trauma often forgotten as it was minor or so long ago (upto 9 mnts; chronic subdurals
- other: eg dec ICP; dural metastases

risk factors
- elderly: brain atrophy makes bridging veins vunerable
- falls (epileptics, alcoholics)
- anticoagulation

## Presentation
symptoms: fluctuating level of consciousness (~35%) +/- insidious physical or intellectual slowing; sleepiness, headache, personality, unsteadiness, and occasionally seizures

signs: inc ICP, seizures; localising neurological symptoms (eg unequal pupils, hemiparesis) occur late, often >1 mnth after injury

ddx: stroke, dementia, CNS massess

## Diagnosis
imaging:
- CT/MRI clot +/- midline shift (but beware b/l isodense clots)
- lf crescent-shaped collection of blood over one hemisphere

## Management
- reverse clotting abnormalities urgently
- surgical management depending on size of clot, chronicity and clinical picture
    - generally those >10mm or with midline shift >5mm need evacuating (via craniotomy or burr hole washout) 
- address cause of trauma (eg falls, abuse)

prognosis: often favourable, but mortality rates high as 50% in those requiring surgery for acute subdurals
