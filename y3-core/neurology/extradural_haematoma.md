# Extradural (epidural) haematoma

## Background
causes
- ? after traumatic skull fracture
- fractured temporal/parietal bone -> laceration middle meningeal artery & vein; typically trauma to temple just lateral to eye
- tear in dural venous sinus
- blood accumulates between bone and dura

##Â Presentation
! beware deteriorating consciousness after head injury that initially produced no loss of consciousness or after initial drowsiness post-injury seems to have resolved

- lucid interval: few hrs -> few days -> dec GCS from rising ICP
- severe headache, vomiting, confusion, and seizures +/- hemiparesis w/ brisk reflexes and upgoing plantar
- bleeding continues -> ipsilateral pupil dilates, coma deepens, b/l limb weakness develops, breathing becomes deep and irregular (brainstem compression)
- death after coma and due to respiratory arrest
- dec HR and inc BP are late signs

## Diagnosis
- CT: haematoma = biconvex/lens-shaped 
- skull XR: normal or fracture crossing course of middle meningeal vessels
- LP contraindicated

ddx: epilepsy, carotid dissection, CO poisoining

## Management
- stablise and transfer urgently (w/ skilled medical & nursing escorts) to a neurosurgical unit for clot evacuation +/- ligation of bleeding vessel
- care of airway in unconscious pt and measure dec ICP -> intubate and ventilate (+ mannitol IVI)

prognosis: 
- excellent if diagnosis and operation early
- poor if coma, pupil abnormalities, or decerebrate rigidity are present pre-op
