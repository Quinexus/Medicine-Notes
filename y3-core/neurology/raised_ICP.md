# Raised Intracranial Pressure

## Background
- volume inside cranium fixed, so any increase in contents can lead to inc ICP
- mass effect, oedema, or obstruction to fluid outflow
- inc ICP -> secondary brain injury and death, needs urgent treatment
- normal ICP in adults <15mmHg, >20mmHg suggests inc ICP

causes
- primary or metastatic tumours
- head injury
- haemorrhage: subdural, extradural, subarachnoid, intracerebral, intraventricular
- infection: meningitis, encephalitis, brain abscess
- hydrocephalus
- cerebral oedema
- status epilepticus
- idiopathic

herniation syndromes
- uncal herniation
  - supratentorial mass pushes inferomedial temporal lobe (uncus) through tentorial notch (opening between supratentorial and infratentorial regions of brain) to compress midbrain
  - IIIrd nerve gets compressed -> dilated ipsilateral pupil, hten opthalmoplegia
  - may be followed (quickly) by contralateral hemiparesis due to pressure on cerebral peduncle
  - coma then occurs due to pressure on ascending reticular activating system in midbrain
- cerebrellar tonsil herniation
  - inc pressure in posterior fossa forces cerebellar tonsils through foramen magnum
  - ataxia, VIth nerve palsy, and up-going plantar reflexes occur first
  - then loss of consciousness, irregular breathing, and apnoea
  - may proceed very rapidly given small size and poor compliance of posterior fossa
- subfalcian (cingulate) herniation
  - frontal mass forces cingulate gyrus (medial frontal lobe) under rigid falx cerebri
  - may be silent unless anterior cerebral artery compressed and causes stroke: contralateral leg weakness +/- abulia (lack of decision-making)

## Presentation
- history of trauma
- headache (worse on coughing, leaning forwards), vomiting
- altered GCS: drowsiness, listlessness, irritability, coma
- dec HR and inc BP (Cushing's response)
- irregular/Cheyne-Stokes respiration
- pupil changes: constriction first, later dilation (do not mask these signs using agents such as tropicamide to dilate pupil for fundoscopy)
- dec visual acuity, peripheral visual field loss
- papilloedema has low sensitivity for inc ICP; loss of venous pulsation at optic disc more sensitivity but difficult to detect and may be absent in ~10% of population

## Diagnosis
- U&E, FBC, LFT, glucose, serum osmolality, clotting, blood culture
- consider toxicology screen
- CXR and other source of infection that might indicate abscess
- CT head
- LP if papilloedema w/ normal imaging: measure opening pressure

## Management
- goal to dec ICP and avert secondary injury
- urgent neurosurgery may be required for definitive treatment of inc ICP from focal causes
- evacuation or temporised w/ burr hole/craniotomy
- ICP monitor (or bolt) placed to monitor pressure and guide neurosurgical critical care

- A & B
  - O2 in hypoxia: hypoxia -> inc ICP due to vasodilatation and cerebral oedema
  - consider sedation for laryngoscopy if needed to secure airway: coughing/resistance can inc ICP
  - normocapnia: CO2 is vasodilator causing inc cerebral blood flow and inc ICP
- C
  - SBP >100-110: hypotension dec cerebral perfusion when cerebral autoregulation impaired
  - HTN needs expert/specialist advice; may be compensatory response to dec cerebral perfusion and BP targets may need to be higher; avoid cerebral vasodilators
  - fluids: only if indicated for volume depletion, avoid hypo-osmolar fluids as dec Na will increase cerebral oedema
- adjuncts
  - head of bed elevated 15-30%; tracheostomy/endotracheal ties positioned to prevent IJV compression
  - treat seizures
  - sedation/analgesia: to prevent coughing, bucking, agitation, and pain contributing to inc ICP; needs expert/critical care
  - fever control: fever inc metabolic rate and causes vasodilatation
  - steroids: only to reduce oedema due to SOL, or if indicated to treat meningitis; inc risk of death in inc ICP due to haemorrhage
  - in select cases under expert guidance only: osmotic agents (eg mannitol), hypertonic saline (benefit may be transient, risks of haemodilution and inc BP), hypothermia (conflicting evidence)
- diagnosis and definitive treatment
  - history, examination and imaging
  - treatment meningitis, encephalitis, and cerebral abscess, and idiopathic intercranial HTN
  - neurosurgical management of inc ICP and definitive treatment of cause where possible
