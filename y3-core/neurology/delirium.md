# Delirium
acute confusional state

## Background
- upto 50% of inpatients >65
- associated w/ longer admission, more complications and higher mortality
- look for underlying cause in any acute fluctuating, baffling behaviour change - may be early indication of treatable pathology

risk factors
- >65yrs
- dementia/previous cognitive impairment
- hip fracture
- acute illness
- psychological agitation (eg pain)

causes
- surgery/post-GA
- systemic infection: pneumonia, UTI, malaria, wounds, IV lines
- intracranial infection or head injury
- drugs/drug withdrawal: opiates, levodopa, sedatives, recreational
- alcohol withdrawal: 2-5d post-admission; inc LFTs; inc MCV; history of alcohol abuse
- metabolic: uraemia, liver failure, Na+ or inc/dec glucose, dec Hb, malnutrition (beriberi)
- hypoxia: respiratory or cardiac failure
- vascular: stroke, MI
- nutritional: thiamine, nicotinic acid or B12 deficiency

## Presentation
- globally impaired cognition, perception, and consciousness 
- which develops over hours/days
- characterised by marked memory deficit, disordered, or disorientated thinking and reversal of sleep-wake cycle
- some pts - tactile or visual hallucinations
  
- hyperactive: restlessness, mood lability, agitation, or agression
- hypoactive: pt becomes slow and withdrawn
- mixed: hypoactive and mixed delirium are much harder to recognise, crucial to compare current behaviour to pt's baseline

## Diagnosis

tests
- look for cause (eg UTI, pneumonia, MI): do FBC, U+E, LFT, glucose, ABG, septic screen (urine dipstick, CXR, cultures)
- consider ECG, malaria films, LP, EEG, CT

differentials
- dementia
- anxiety
- epilepsy: non-convulsive status epilepticus is underdiagnosed cause of impaired cognition and odd behaviour - consider an EEG
- primary mental illness (eg schizophrenia) can also mimic delirium but rare on wards (esp if no PMH)

## Management
as well as identifying and treating underlying cause aim to:
- reorietate pt
  - explain where they are and who you are at each encounter
  - hunt down hearing aids/glasses
  - visible clocks/calendars may help
- encourage visits from friends and family
- monitor fluid balance and encourage oral intake; be vigilant for constipation
- mobilise and encourage physical activity
- practise sleep hygiene: restrict daytime napping, minimise night-time disturbance
- avoid or remove catheters, IV cannulae, monitoring leads and other devices (they increase infection risk and may get pulled out)
- watch out for infection and physical discomfort/distress
- review medication and discontinue any unecessary angets
  - only use sedation if pt is risk to their own/other pts' safety (never use physical restraints)
  - consider short-term haloperidol PO if take it, IM if not
  - wait 20min to judge effect - further doses can be given if needed

note: avoid in those w/ Parkinson's disease or lewy body dementia

be aware delirium may persist beyond the duration of original illness by several weeks in the elderly

do not assume this must be dementia - provide support and reassess 1-2 months later
