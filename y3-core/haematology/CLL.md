# Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia

## Background
- commonest leukaemia
  - >25%
  - incidence: ~5/100000/yr
- M:F~2:1
- median age at diagnosis = 65yrs
- hallmark is progressive accumulation of malignant clone of functionally incompetent B cells
- mutations, trisomies and deletions influence risk

- rai stage 0, lymphocytosis alone, median survival >13yrs
- I: lymphocytosis + lymphadenopathy, 8yrs
- II: lymphocytosis + spleno/hepatomegaly, 5yrs
- III: lymphocytosis + anaemia (<110), 2yrs
- IV: lymphocytosis + platelets <100x109, 1yr

## Presentation
symptoms
- often none
- surprise finding on routine FBC
- pts may be anaemic or infection-prone
- or dec weight, sweats, anorexia if severe

signs
- enlarged, rubbery, non-tender nodes
- splenomegaly, hepatomegaly

## Diagnosis
- inc lymphocytes - may be marked
- later
  - autoimmune haemolysis
  - marrow infiltration: dec Hb, dec neutrophils, dec platelets

complications
1. autoimmune haemolysis
2. inc bacterial infections due to hypogammaglobulinaemia (= dec IgG), especially encapsulated organisms
3. severe T cell immunosuppression w/ inc susceptibility to viral and fungal infections
4. marrow failure
5. inc risk of 2ndary malignancies
6. risk of transformation to more aggressive disease (consider if rapidly enlarging nodes, rapid inc in LDH, B symptoms)

## Management
- depends on age/fitness and presence of certain mutations
- many pts managed on 'watch and wait' basis safely for several years
- consider treatment if symptomatic
- options
  - FCR (fludarabine + cyclophosphamide + rituximab)
  - ibrutinib (bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor; SE: myelosuppression, AF, and bleeding) monotherapy
  - venetoclax (BCL-2 inhibitor; SE: tumour lysis syndrome, myelosuppression) + obinutuzumab and BR (bendamustine + rituximab)
  - steroids and IV immunoglobulin help autoimmune haemolysis (seen after treatment w/ fludarabine)
  - RT helps lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly
  - stem cell transplantation
  - supportive care
    - transfusions
    - IV human immunoglobulin if recurrent infection +/- antimicrobial prophylaxis

natural history
- 1/3 never progress (or even regress)
- 1/3 progress slowly
- 1/3 progress actively
- CD23 and beta2-microglobulin correlate w/ bulk of disease and rates of progression
- death often due to infection or transformation to aggressive lymphoma (Richter's syndrome)
