# Iron Deficiency Anaemia

## Background
common: 1/3 all women of reproductive age anaemic & majority IDA (WHO)

aetiology
- blood loss (assume cause until proven otherwise)
- poor diet/poverty cause IDA in babies/children (rarely in adults)
- malabsorption (eg coeliac) is refractory cause of IDA
- tropics, hookworm (GI) most common

## Presentation
- chronic ida (signs now rare: koilonychia)
- atophic glossitis
- angular cheilosis(/stomatitis): ulceration at side of mouth; also seen in B12, B2 deficiency, and glucagonoma
- rarely post-cricoid webs (Plummer-Vinson syndrome)

## Diagnosis
- blood film: microcytic, hypochromic anaemia w/ anisocytosis and poikilocytosis
- dec MCV, MCH and MCHC
- confirmed by dec ferritin (also dec serum iron w/ inc TIBC (less reliable)): acute phase protein, inc w/ inflammation, may be 'falsely normal' in iron-deficient pts w/ comorbidities
- transferrin saturation (TSAT = ration of iron to TIBC): <20% = iron deficiency
- check coeliac serology in all; if -ve -> refer all males & post-menopause females for gastroscopy & colonoscopy
- consider stool microscopy for ova if relevant travel history; (faecal occult blood not recommeded)

IDA w/ no obvious source of bleeding mandates careful GI workup

Interpreting plasma iron studies
|-Condition-|-Iron-|-TIBC-|-Ferritin-|
|-----------|------|------|----------|
| iron deficiency| dec | inc | dec |
| anaemia of chronic disease | dec | dec | inc |
| chronic haemolysis | inc | dec | inc |
| haemochromatosis | inc | dec/norm |  inc |
| pregnancy | inc | inc | norm |
| sideroblastic anaemia | inc | normal | inc |

## Management 
- treat cause
- oral iron (SE: nausea, abdo discomfort, diarrhoea, constipation, black stools)
    - Hb should rise 1g/L/wk, w/ modest reticulocytosis
    - continue for at least 3 mnths after Hb normalises to replenish stores
    - conisder IV if oral poorly tolerated, if rapid correction/resolutioon of symptoms required, or where oral is likely to be ineffective (eg. functional iron deficiency in CKD, malabsorption, or inflammation)
- check complicance if failure to respond
    - GI disturbance?
    - modify dose w/ different preparation or alternate-day dosing
    - consider continued blood loss, malabsorption, anaemia of chronic disease or misdiagnosis
