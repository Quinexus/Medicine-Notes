# Acute Myeloid Leukaemia
neoplastic proliferation of blast cells derived from marrow myeloid elements; it progresses rapidly
(5yr survival 55% for pts <60, and 17% for pts >60 after Rx)

## Background
incidence
- commonest acute leukaemia of adults (1/10000/yr, increases w/ age)
- median age at presentation = 65-70
- can be long term complication of chemotherapy
- also assoc w/ myelodysplastic states, prior radiation and syndromes

morphological classification
four types based on WHO histological classification, cytogenetics, and molecular genetics
1. AML w/ recurrent genetic abnormalities
2. AML multilineage dysplasia (eg 2nd ary to pre-existing myelodysplatic syndrome)
3. AML, therapy related (in those previously treated w/ cytotoxic drugs)
4. AML, other (not fitting above-listed)

## Presentation
- marrow failure
  - anaemia, infection or bleeding
  - DIC occurs in acute promyelocytic leukaemia (subtype of AML), where there is release of thromboplastin
- infiltration: hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, gum hypertrophy, skin involvement; CNS involvement at presentation is rare

complications
- predisposition to infection: 
  - prophylaxis given
  - be alert to septicaemia: common organisms present oddly and rare organisms can infect commonly (particularly fungi Candida and Aspergillus)
  - AML itself causes fever
- chemotherapy
  - inc plasma urate levels (from tumour lysis) - allopurinol + hydration w/ IVF
  - leukostasis may occur if inc inc WCC
    - associated w/ very high blast count
    - manifestations inc respiratory compromise, altered mental status, visual changes, and headache

## Diagnosis
- WCC is often inc but can be normal or even low
- blast cells may be few in peripheral blood, so diagnosis depends on bone marrow biopsy, immunophenotyping, and molecular methods
- on biopsy, AML differentiated from ALL by Auer rods
- cytogenetic analysis guides treatment recommendations and prognosis; >=3 cytogenetics abnormalities assoc w/ worse prognosis

## Management
Rx: IV fluids, rapid initiation of chemo, leukapheresis, or RT

- supportive care As for ALL
- chemotherapy
  - very intensive -> long periods of marrow suppression w/ neutropenia + platelets dec
  - main drugs used include daunorubicin and cytarabine w/ ~5 cycles given in 1-week blocks to get a remission (RAS mutations occur in ~20% of pts w/ AML and enhance sensitivity to cytarabine)
- bone marrow transplant (BMT)
  - pluripotent haematopoetic stem cells collected from marrow
  - allogenic transplants from HLA-matched donors (held on international databases) are indicated in refractory or relapsing disease
  - idea to destroy leukaemic cells and immune system by eg cyclophosphamide + total body irradiation, then repopulate the marrow w/ donor cells infused IV
  - ciclosporin +/- methotrexate are used to reduce effect the new marrow attacking pt's body (graft vs host disease (GVHD))
    - complications: GVHD (may help explain curative effect of BMT); opportunistic infections, relapse of leukaemia, infertility
    - prognosis: lower relapse rates ~60% long-term survivors, but significant mortality of ~10%; autologous BMT (stem cells are taken from pt themselves) used in intermediate-prognosis disease
    - autologous mobilised peripheral blood stem cell transplantation may offer faster haemopoietic recovery and less morbidity
- supportive care, or lower-dose chemotherapy for disease control, may be more appropriate in elderly pts, where intensive therapies have poorer outcomes
