# Hodgkin's Lymphoma
- malignant proliferations of lymphocytes
- accumulate in lymph nodes causing lymphadenopathy but may also be found in peripheral blood or infiltrate organs
- characteristic cells w/ mirror-image nuclei = Reed-Sternberg

## Background
- incidence: two peaks
  - young adults (HL commonest malignancy in 15-24yr-olds)
  - elderly
- M:F~2:1
- inc incidence in industrialised countries

risk factors
- an affected sibling
- EBV
- SLE
- post-transplantation

## Presentation
- enlarged, non-tender, 'rubbery', superficial lymph nodes (60-70% cervical also axiallary or inguinal)
- node size may fluctuate and can become matted
- 25% have constitutional upset eg fever, weight loss (>10% in 6 months), night sweats, pruritis, and lethargy
- alcohol-induced lymph node pain
- mediastinal lymph node involvement can cause mass effect eg bronchial or SVC obstructin, or direct extension eg causing pleural effusions

signs
- lymphadenopathy
- cachexia
- anaemia
- spleno- or hepatomegaly

## Diagnosis
tissue diagnosis
- lymph node excision biopsy if possible 
  - supraclavicular > cervical/axillary > inguinal
  - send for pathology
  - immunohistochemistry/flow cytometry
- image-guided needle biopsy, laparotomy or mediastinoscopy may be needed

bloods
- FBC, film, ESR, LFT, LDH, urate, Ca2+
- inc ESR or dec Hb indicate worse prognosis
- LDH inc as it is released during cell turnover

imaging
- CXR
- CT/PET of thorax, abdo, and pelvis

staging - Ann Arbor system: influences treatment and prognosis; done by imaging +/- marrow biopsy if B symptoms or stage III-IV disease
- I confined to single lymph node region
- II involvement of 2+ nodal areas on the same side of diaphragm
- III involvement of nodes on both sides of diaphragm
- IV spread beyond lymph nodes eg liver or bone marrow
each stage is either 
- 'A' no systemic symptoms other than pruritis
- 'B' presence of B symptoms: weight loss >10% in last 6 months, unexplained fever >38oC, or night sweats (needing change of clothes)
'B' indicates worse disease
localised extranodal extension does not advance the stage, but is indicated by subscripted 'E' eg I-AE

## Management
chemoradiotherapy
- RT + short course chemo for stages I-A and II-A (eg w/ <=3 areas involved)
- longer courses of chemo for II-A w/ >3 areas involved through IV-B
- ABVD: adriamycin (doxorubicin), bleomycin, vinblastin, dacarbazine cures ~80% of pts
- more intensive regimens are used if poor prognosis or advanced disease
- in relapsed disease: high-dose chemo followed by autologous stem cell transplantation
- bretuximab vedotin + doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (BV + AVD) is promising new combination chemo

complications
- RT 
  - second malignancies (related to dose and field, w/ long latency & inc risk over time)
  - solid tumours (esp lung and breast, also melanoma, sarcoma, stomach, and thyroid cancers)
  - ischaemic heart disease
  - valvular heart or pericardial disease
  - hypothyroidism
  - lung fibrosis due to radiation field
- chemotherapy
  - myelosuppression
  - nausea
  - alopecia
  - infection
- both
  - NHL
  - infertility

5-yr survival
- depends on stage and grade
- >95% in I-A lymphocyte-predominant disease
- <40% w/ IV-B lymphocyte depleted
- competing risks in temrs of overall survival between minimising risk of recurrence and also preventing treatment-related complications such as secondary malignancy and CVD

classification
- nodular sclerosing (70%) - good prognosis
- mixed cellularity (20-25%) - good prognosis
- lymphocyte rich (5%) - good prognosis
- lymphocyte depleted (<1%) - poor prognosis
nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin’s is recognized as a separate entity, behaving as an indolent b-cell lymphoma
higher incidence and worse prognosis if HIV +ve

emergency presentations
- infection
- svc obstruction - inc JVP
- sensation of fullness in the head
- dyspnoea
- blackouts
- facial oedema
