# Anaemia of Chronic Disease

## Background
- commonest anaemia in hospital pts (2nd commonest after IDA worldwide)
- pathophysiology (hepcidin)
  1. poor use of iron in erythropoiesis
  2. cytokine-induced shortening of rbc survival
  3. dec production of and response to erythropoietin

causes: many eg chronic infection, vasculitis, rheumatoid, malignancy, CKD

## Presentation

## Diagnosis
- ferritin normal or inc
- mild normocytic or microcytic anaemia
- often inc ESR/CRP
- check blood film, B12, folate, TSH, and tests for haemolysis

##Â Management
- treat underlying disease
- erythropoitin-stimulating agent (SE: 'flu-like' symptoms, HTN, mild inc platelets, and thromboembolism)
- may improve QoL in non-haem malignancies (or low-risk MDS) where symptomatic anaemia due to chemo (seek expert advice)
- IV iron overcome functional iron deficiency
