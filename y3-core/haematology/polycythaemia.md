# Polycythaemia
refers to inc Hb >16.5 in men or >16 in women and/or Hct >49% in men or >48% in women

## Background
- relative polycythaemia
  - dec plasma vol, normal RBC mass
  - may be acute (due to volume depletion)
  - or chronic (associated w/ obesity, HTN & inc alcohol/tobacco intake)
- absolute polycythaemia
  - inc RBC mass
  - measured by dilution of infused autologous radioactive chromium (51Cr-labelled RBCs)
  - causes
    - primary (polycythaemia vera)
    - secondary due to hypoxia (eg high altitudes, chronic lung disease, cyanotic disease, cyanotic congenital heart disease, heavy smoking )or inapproriate inc erythropoeitin secretion (eg RCC, HCC)
  
## Diagnosis
- initial investigations include: Hx, physical exam, pulse oximetry, FBC, peripheral blood smear
- check if any evidence of volume depletion and thus if Hb corrects w/ fluid repletion
- ?polycythaemia vera from presentation (eg tinnitus, itching, erythromelalgia) send JAK2 V617F mutation screen
- if not check serum EPO
- is inc EPO in keeping w/ known cardiorespiratory disease? if not check carboxyhaemoglobin - inc carboxyhaemoglobin suggests secondary polycythaemia due to CO toxicity from smoking or other exposure
- if carboxyhaemoglobin normal and no other clear explanation (eg post-transplant erythrocytosis complicates 10-20% of renal allograft), consider CT/MRI abdo/pelvis to rule out EPO-secreting tumour
- seek haem advice

# Polycythaemia vera

## Background
- malignant proliferation of clone dervied from one pluripotent stem cell
- mutation in JAK2 (JAK2 V617F) is present in >95%
- erythroid progenitor offspring are unusual in not needing erythropoietin to avoid apoptosis
- there is excess proliferation of RBCs, WBCs, and platelets -> hyperviscosity and thrombosis
- commoner if >60yr

## Presentation
- may be asymptomatic and detected on FBC
- present w/ vague symptoms due to hyperviscosity
  - headaches
  - dizziness
  - tinnitus
  - visual disturbance
- itching after a hot bath, and erythromelagia, a burning sensation in fingers and toes, are characteristic
- signs: facial plethora and splenomegaly (in 60%)
- gout may occur due to inc urate from RBC turnover
- features of arterial (cardiac, cerebral, peripheral) or venous (DVT, cerebral, hepatic) thrombosis may be present

## Diagnosis
- FBC: inc RCC, inc Hb, inc HCT, inc PCV, often also inc WBC and inc platelets
- inc B12
- marrow shows hypercellularity w/ erythroid hyperplasia
- cytogenetics as required to differentiate from CML
- dec serum erythropoietin
- raised red cell mass on 51Cr studies and splenomegaly, in setting of normal PaO2 is diagnostic

## Management
- aim to keep HCT <0.45 to dec risk of thrombosis
- in younger pts at low risk, this is done by venesection
- if higher risk (age >60yrs, previous thrombosis), hydroxycarbamide (=hydroxyurea) is used
- interferon alfa preferred in women of childbearing age, ruxolitinib 2nd line, aspirin 75mg daily is also given

prognosis
- variable many remain well for years
- thrombosis and haemorrhage (due to defective platelets) are main complications
- transition to myelofibrosis occurs in ~30% or acute leukaemia in ~5%
- monitor FBC every 3 months
