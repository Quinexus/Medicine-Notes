# Myelofibrosis

## Background
hyperplasia of megakaryocytes which produce platelet-derived growth factor, leading to intense marrow fibrosis and haematopoiesis in spleen/liver -> massive hepatosplenomegaly

## Presentation
- hypermetabolic symptoms
  - night sweats
  - fever
  - weight loss
- abdo discomfort due to splenomegaly
- bone marrow failure (dec Hb, infections, bleeding)

## Diagnosis
film
- leukerythroblastic cells (nucleated red cells)
- characteristic teardrop RBCs
- dec Hb
- bone marrow trephine for diagnosis

## Management
- marrow support
- allogeneic stem cell transplant may be curative in young people
- ruxolitinib, fedratinib, or hydroxycarbamide if transplant ineligible and symptomatic

prognosis: median survival 4-5yrs
