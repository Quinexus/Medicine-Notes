# Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
includes all lymphomas w/o Reed-Sternberg cells

## Background
classfied as: B-cell or T- and NK-cell derived
- most from B-cell lines
- diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) commonest

not all centre on nodes (extranodal tissues generating lymphoma include mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue)
incidence: 2:10000
median age at diagnosis: 67yrs

causes
- immunodeficiency - drugs
- prior RT or chemo
- viruses or bacteria
  - HIV: usually high-grade lymphoma from EBV transformed cells
  - EBV: associated endemic Burkitt's lymphoma, DLBCL, NK-T-cell lymphoma
  - HTLV-1: adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma
  - Helicobacter pylori; marginal zone lymphoma
- toxins
- autoimmune condition
- congential

## Presentation
signs and symptoms
- superficial lymphadenopathy (75% at presentation)
- extranodal disease (50%)

gut (commonest)
1. gastric MALT
   - H. pylori and may regress w/ its eradication
   - symptoms: as for gastric Ca w/ systemic features
   - usually involves antrum, multifocal, and metastases late
2. non-MALT gastric lymphomas (60%)
   - usually diffuse large-cell B lymphomas
   - high-grade and not responding well to H. pylori eradication
4. small-bowel lymphomas
   - eg IPSID (immunoproliferative small intestine disease)
   - or EATCL (enteropathy/coeliac-associated intra-epithelial T-cell lymphoma)
   - presents w/ diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and dec weight
   - poor prognosis

skin (2nd commonest): eg clonal T cells in mycosis fungoides (accounts for ~50%)

oropharynx: waldeyer's ring lymphoma causes sore throat/obstructed breathing

other possible sites: bone, CNS, lung

systemic features: 
- low-grade-NHL: none/mild symptoms, lymphadenopathy
- high-grade-NHL: weight loss, night sweats, fevers

## Diagnosis
blood
- FBC, U+E, LFT
- inc LDH ~ worse prognosis, reflecting inc cell turnover
- marrow and node biopsy for classification (complex, based on WHO system)

staging
- Ann Arbor system
- PET-CT CAP
- send cytology of any effusion
- LP for CSF cytology if CNS signs

mdt approach from clinical evaluation, histology, immunology, molecular genetics and imaging
- low-grade lymphomas
  - indolent, often incurable, and widely disseminated
  - include: 
    - follicular lymphoma (2nd most common NHL - 20%)
    - marginal zone lymphoma/MALT
    - lymphocytic lymphoma (closely related to CLL and treated similarly)
    - lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma (produces IgM = Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia)
- high-grade lymphoma
  - more aggressive, but often curable
  - rapidly enlarging lymphadenopathy w/ systemic symptoms
  - include
    - Burkitt's lymphoma (childhood disease w/ characteristic jaw lymphadenopathy)
    - lymphoblastic lymphomas (like ALL)
    - diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (most common subtype NHL - 25%)

## Management
low grade
- if symptomless, none may be needed
- RT may be curative localised disease
- chlorambucil used in diffuse disease
- remission may be maintained by using interferon alfa or rituximab
- bendamustine effective in both w/ rituximab and as monotherapy in rituximab-refractory pts

high grade
- 'R-CHOP' regimen
  - Rituximab
  - Cyclophosphamide
  - Hydroxydanunorubicin
  - vincristine (Oncovin)
  - Prednisolone
- granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) help neutropenia eg filgrastim or lenograstim (at low doses it may be cost-effective)

survival: histology important, prognosis worse if at presentation
- age >60yrs
- systemic symptoms
- bulky disease (abdominal mass >10cm)
- inc LDH
- disseminated disease
typical 5yr survival for treated pts: ~30% for high-grade and >50% for low-grade lymphomas, but picture is very variable

indications for treatment in indolent lymphomas
- cytopenias secondary to BM infiltration
- threatened end-organ function
- symptoms attributable to disease
- bulk at presentation
- steady progression during period of observation >6 months
- presentation w/ concurrent histologic transformation
- massive splenomegaly
