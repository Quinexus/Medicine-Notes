# Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia
characterised by an uncontrolled proliferation of myeloid cells

## Background
- accounts for 15% of leukaemias
- myeloproliferative disorder
- occurs most often between 40-60yrs, w/ slight male predominance, rare in childhood
- inc risk associated w/ prior radiation exposure

philadelphia chromosome (Ph)
- present in >80%
- hybrid chromosome, reciprocal translocation: long arm of Chr9 and long arm of chr22
- t(9;22)
- gene fusion BCL/ABL on chr22 = tyrosine kinase activity
- w/o Ph = worse prognosis
- some pts have masked translocation - cytogenetics do not show Ph but rearrangement detectable by molecular techniques

##Â Presentation
symptoms
- mostly chronic and insidious
- dec weight, tiredness, fever, sweats
- features of gout (purine breakdown)
- bleeding (platelet dysfunction)
- abdominal discomfort (splenic enlargement)
- ~30% detected by chance

signs
- splenomegaly (>75%) - often massive
- hepatomegaly, anaemia, bruising

## Diagnosis
- inc inc WBC w/ whole spectrum of myeloid cells
- dec Hb or normal, platelets variable
- inc urate, inc B12
- bone marrow hypercellular
- cytogenetic analysis of blood or bone marrow for pH

natural history
- 5yr survival 90%
- 3 phases
  - chronic: lasting months or years of few, if any, symptoms
  - accelerated phase: defined as 10-19% blast cells in peripheral blood or bone marrow as per WHO w/ increasing symptoms and spleen size
  - blast transformation: w/ features of acute leukaemia +/- death

## Management

- genotype based: imatinib, a BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor
- SE mild: nausea, cramps, oedema, rash, headache, arthralgia; may cause myelosuppression
- more potent 2nd generation BCR-ABL inhibitors: dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib
- dasatinib and nilotinib allow more pts to achieve deeper, more rapid responses assoc w/ improved outcomes but only indicated in chronic- or accelerated-phase pts who are intolerant/resistant to imatinib
- hydroxycarbamide also used
- lymphoblastic transformation may benefit from treatment as for ALL: w/ chemo rare to achieve remission and allogenic transplantation offers best hope
- stem cell transplantation
  - allogenic from HLA-matched sibling or untreated donor offers only cure but significant morbidity and mortality
  - only rarely used 1st line in young pts (where mortality rates are lower)
  - others BCR-ABL inhibitor
  - pts reviewed annually to decide whether to continue, to offer combination therapy or stem cell transplantation
