# Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia
- malignancy of lymphoid cells - B/T cell lineages 
- arresting maturation and promoting proliferation of immature blast cells w/ marrow failure and tissue infiltration

## Background
- assoc
  - ionising radiation during pregnancy
  - down's syndrome

- commonest cancer of childhood
- 15% leukaemia in adults

classification
- surface markers used to classify ALL into
  - precursor B-cell ALL
  - T-cell ALL
  - B-cell ALL
- cytogenetic features characterised by chromosome analysis and FISH
- molecular techniques for mutation analysis and gene expression studies

## Presentation
- marrow failure: anaemia (dec Hb), infection (dec WCC), and bleeding (dec platelets)
- infiltration
  - hepato- and splenomegaly
  - lymphadenopathy - superficial or mediastinal
  - orichidomegaly
  - CNS involvement eg CN palsies, menigism

common infections
- esp chest, mouth, perianal, and skin
- bacterial septicaemia, zoster, CMV, measles, candidiasis, pneumocytis pneumonia

## Diagnosis
- FBC (WCC usually high), PT, APTT, fibrinogen, LFTs, U+E
- immunophenotyping of blood or bone marrow to identify blast cells
- DNA analysis is required to detect chromosome abnormalities
- CXR & CT scan to look for mediastinal and abdominal lymphadenoapathy
- lp for CNS involvement

## Management
- eduate and motivate pt to promote engagement w/ therapy
- support
  - blood/platelet transfusions
  - IV fluids
  - allopurinol (prevents tumour lysis syndrome)
  - insert s/c port system/Hickman line for IV access
- infections
  - dangerous due to neutropenia
  - immediate IV Abx
  - neutropenic sepsis regimen and prophylactic antivirals, antifungals, and antibiotics
- chemotherapy: prolonged chemotherapy required for cure; depends on age and presence/absence of Philadelphia chromosome
  - remission induction: eg vincristine, prednisolone, L-asparaginase + danuorubicin; BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor should be combined w/ steroids and chemotherapy if it is Ph+ ALL
  - consolidation: high-medium-dose therapy in 'blocks' over several weeks
  - CNS prophylaxis: intrathecal (or high-dose IV) methotrexate +/- CNS irradiation
  - maintenance: prolonged chemotherapy eg mercaptopurine (daily), methotrexate (weekly), and vincristine + prednisolone (monthly) for 2yrs; relapse can occur in blood, CNS, or testis (examine these sites at follow-up)
- matched related allogeneic marrow transplantations: once in 1st remission is the best option in standard-risk younger adults

haematological remission = no evidence of leukaemia in blood, a normal or recovering blood count, and <5% blasts in a normal regenerating marrow

prognosis
- cure rates for children are 70-90%
- for adults only 405 (higher when imatinib/rituximab)
- poor prognosis if
  - age >=40
  - male
  - philadelphia chromosome
  - presentation w/ CNS signs
  - dec Hb
  - WCC > 100x109
  - B-cell ALL
- PCR used to detect minimal residual disease, undetectable by standard means
- prognosis in relapsed Ph-negative ALL is poor (but improvable by marrow transplant)

personalised treatment
- aim to tailor therapy to exact gene defect and according to individual metabolism
- new treatments for relapsed disease include blinatumomab and inotuzumab
- CAR-T cells have shown excellent responses in aLL
- clinical trials are an option for pts w/ relapsed/refractory disease
- biomarkers, eg thiopurine methyltransferase can predict toxicity from thiopurines
