# Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis

## Background
commonest glomerulonephritis on kidney biopsy

aetiology
- primary: idiopathic
- secondary: HIV, heroin, lithium, lymphoma, any cause of dec kidney mass/nephrons, scarring due to another glomerulonephritis

- risk of progressive CKD and kidney failure: inc proteinuria worsens prognosis
- primary disease recurs in 30-50% of transplants

## Presentation

## Diagnosis
glomeruli have scarring of certain segments (ie focal sclerosis)
may miss early disease if <10 glomeruli in biopsy sample

## Management
- ACE-i/ARB and blood pressure control in all
- SGLT2 inhibitor
- corticosteroids in primary disease: remission ~25%, partial remission in up to 50%
- calcineurin inhibitors used second line or if SE of steroids are significant
- plasma exchange and rituximab have been used for recurrence in transplants
