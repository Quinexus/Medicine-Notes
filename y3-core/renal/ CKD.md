# Chronic Kidney Disease
abnormal kidney structure or function, present for >3 months, w/ implications for health

## Background
classification
- based on GFR category
- presence of albuminuria as marker of kidney damage
- cause of kidney disease

classification by GFR
category - GFR - notes
- G1 >90: only CKD if other evidence of kidney damage: protein/haematuria, pathology on biopsy/imaging, tubule disorder, transplant
- G2 60-89
- G3A 45-59: mild-moderate dec GFR
- G3B 30-44: moderate-severe dec GFR
- G4 15-29: severe dec GFR
- G5 <15: kidney failure

classification by albuminuria
category - albumin excretion (mg/24h) - albumin:creatinine ration (ACR) (mg/mmol)
- A1 <30 <3
- A2 30-300 3-30
- A3 >300 >30

classification by underlying disease
- glomerular
  - primary: minimal change, membranous
  - systemic: diabetes, amyloid
- tubulointerstitial
  - primary: UTI, pyelonephritis, stones
  - systemic: drugs, toxins, sarcoid
- blood flow/vessels
  - primary: kidney limited vasculitis
  - systemic: heart failure, TTP
- congenital/genetic
  - primary: renal dysplasia
  - systemic: alport syndrome, fabry disease
- transplant
  - primary: recurrence of primary kidney disease
  - systemic: calcineurin inhibitor toxicity

epidemiology
- 10% of adults and upto 45000 premature deaths per year in UK
- commonest aetiologies
  - diabetes
  - glomerulonephritis
  - inc BP/renovascular disease
- dec GFR and albuminuria are independently assoc w/ inc risk
  - all-cause mortality
  - cardiovascular mortality
  - progressive kidney disease and kidney failure
  - AKI
- pts w/ CKD are more likely to die of CVD than to need RRT
- risk of adverse outcomes in CKD can be represented as a 'heat map' according to GFR and albuminuria categories

risk factors for disease progression
- inc BP
- DM
- proteinuria
- metabolic disturbance
- volume depletion
- infection
- NSAIDs
- smoking
- obstruction
- inc risk of superimposed AKI: treat illness promptly, monitor fluid balance and kidney function

## Presentation
history
- does pt really have CKD? does eGFR reflect true GFR?
  - consider non-steady state eg AKI, drugs (eg trimethoprim alters Cr conc but not GFR)
  - pregnancy (eGFR formulae underestimate)
  - malnutrition
  - evidence of chronicity >3 months - is there previous Cr on record?
- possible cause
  - ask about inc BP, DM, IHD, UTI, LUTS, systemic symptoms, renal colic
  - check drug history and when medications started
  - FHx including kidney disease and SAH
  - systems review: look out for more than immediately obvious, consider rare causes, ask about eyes, skin, joints, symptoms suggestive of systemic disorder, and malignancy
- current state
  - pts may or may not have symptoms of CKD
  - symptoms are more common once eGFR <15: fluid overload (SOB, oedema), anorexia, N&V, restless legs, fatigue, pruritis, bone pain, amenorrhoea, impotence

examination
- periphery
  - oedema, signs of peripheral vascular disease, neuropathy, vasculitic rash, gouty tophi, joint disease
  - arteriovenous fistula (thrill, bruit, recent needling?)
  - signs of immunosuppression: bruising from steroids, skin changes/malignancy
  - uraemic flap/encephalopathy are late signs
- face
  - xanthelasma
  - yellow tinge (uraemia)
  - jaundice (hepatorenal)
  - gum hypertrophy (ciclosporin)
  - cushingoid (steroids)
  - periorbital oedema (nephrotic syndrome)
  - taut skin/telangiectasis (scleroderma)
  - facial lipodystrophy (glomerulonephritis)
- neck
  - JVP for fluid state
  - tunnelled line (small scar over IJV and larger scar in 'breast pocket' area)
  - parathyroidectomy scar
  - lymphadenopathy
- cardiovascular
  - BP
  - sternotomy
  - cardiomegaly
  - stigmata of endocarditis
  - if R-sided HF/TR, JVP may not reflect fluid state
- respiratory: pulmonary oedema or effusion
- abdomen
  - PD catheter or scars from previous catheter (small scars just below umbilicus and to side of midline)
  - signs of transplant (scar, palpable graft)
  - ballotable polycystic kidneys +/- palpable liver

## Diagnosis
- blood
  - serum creatinine & U+E (compare w/ previous)
  - Hb (normochromic, normocytic anaemia)
  - glucose (DM)
  - dec Ca2+, inc PO43-, inc PTH (renal osteodystrophy)
  - directed investigation for intrinsic kidney disease
    - ANA, dsDNA, ANCA, antiphopholipid antibodies
    - serum light chains and paraprotein
    - complement
    - cryoglobulin
    - anti-GBM
    - hepatitis serology
    - anti-PLA2R (ESR is not sensitive inc CKD and proteinuric states)
- urine dipstick (may not detect albumin), uACR/uPCR, MC&S
- imaging
  - USS for anatomy, size, symmetry, corticomedullary differentiation (non-specific) and to exclude obstruction
  - CKD kidneys may be small (<9cm) except in infiltrative disorders (amyloid, myeloma), APKD, and DM
  - if asymmetrical consider renovascular disease
  - isotope scans are more sensitive for scarring
- histology
  - consider kidney biopsy in nephrotic syndrome, systemic disease w/ kidney involvement, progressive disease, AKI w/o recovery, CKD w/o obvious cause
  - DM may not need biopsy unless atypical ie haematuria, systemic symptoms, no other microvascular disease (retinopathy/neuropathy)

- consider pt view/preference
- GFR and albuminuria should be monitored at least annually, according to risk
- if high risk, monitor every 6 months
- if very high risk, monitor every 3-4 months
- a change in eGFR stage w/ dec eGFR >=25% is significant
- rapid progression is dec eGFR >15

## Management
range of disease from mild disease w/o progression to advanced, symptomatic disease requiring renal replacement

management of CKD requires
1. information and education for people w/ CKD
2. treatment to slow kidney disease progression
3. treatment of complications of CKD
4. management of CV risk in CVD
5. preparation for RRT (dialysis/transplantation)

referral to nephrology
- 5yr risk of RRT >5% using four-variable Kidney Failure Risk Equation
- moderate proteinuria uACR >70mg/mmol unless due to DM and already treated
- proteinura uACR >30mg/mmol w/ haematuria
- kidney disease progression
  - dec egFR >=25% + dec eGFR category w/in 12 months
  - sustained dec eGFR >15 w/in 12 months
- HTN despite 4 agents or ?renal artery stenosis
- known or ? rare or genetic cause of CKD

**treatment to slow kidney disease progression**
- BP uACR <70: systolic <140 (120-139) & diastolic <90
- DM or uACR >=70: systolic <130 (120-129) & diastolic <80

- renin-angiotensin inhibition
  - DM and uACR >3mg/mmol
  - HTN and uACR >30mg/mmol
  - any CKD w/ uACR >70mg/mmol
  - do not combine agents due to risk of hyperkalaemia and hypotension
  - check K+ and kidney function prior to and 1-2wks after starting treatment, or change in dose
  - stop if K >6mmol/L, dec eGFR >25% or inc creatinine >30%: exclude other possible causes of dec eGFR and use lowest tolerated dose
- SGLT2 inhibitors
  - eGFR >25 + uACR >25 + T2DM (caution DKA) or CKD not due to DM (insufficient data in polycystic kidney disease and after kidney transplant)
  - fast-moving field: check up-to-date eGFR, uACR, and disease criteria for use
- glycaemic control in DM: target HbA1c of ~53 unless risk of hypoglycaemia, comorbidity, or limited life expectancy
- lifestyle
  - exercise
  - healthy weight
  - smoking cessation
  - salt intake reduced to <2g of sodium/day (<=5g sodium chloride/day)

**treatment of complications of CKD**
anaemia
- investigate (esp if anaemic w/ eGFR >60) and other deficiencies: iron (hypochromic red cells >6%, reticulocyte Hb content >29pg, transferrin saturation <20%, ferritin <100), B12, and folate
- do not miss chronic blood loss
- IV iron therapy may be needed and treat w/ an erythropoietic stimulating agent (ESA, 'Epo') to maintain Hb 100-120g/L
- pure red cell aplasia w/ ESA treatment due to anti-erythropoietin antibodies and usually causes Hb <60
  - very rare: exclude more likely causes of anaemia first
- avoid blood transfusions whenever possible, esp if kidney transplantation is predicted
- care w/ ESA in sickle cell disease as may increase sickle cell %

acidosis
- consider sodium bicarbonate supplements for pts w/ eGFR <30 and low serum bicarbonate (<22mmol/L)
- caution in HTN and fluid overload

oedema
- restrict fluid and Na intake if clinically indicated
- loop diuretics can be used
- high dose may be required in advanced CKD
- loop and thiazide diuretic combination can be potent: distal tubule sodium excretion (and inhibition by thiazide) is increased when treated w/ loop
- monitor clinical fluid state and kidney function

CKD bone-mineral disorders
- CKD causes inc PO4 and reduced hydroxylation of vitamin D
- measure Ca2+, PO4, ALP, PTH, and 25-OH vit D if eGFR <30 (optimal conc unknown)
- avoid overt hyperphosphataemia (target phosphate in advanced CKD is higher than upper reference limit), avoid hypercalcaemia
  - dietary restriction +/- phosphate binders
  - eg calcium acetate (avoid in hypercalcaemia), sevelamer, sucroferric oxyhydroxide, lanthanum
- give vitamin D supplements (colecalciferol, ergocalciferol) if deficient; if inc PTH persists or is increasting treat w/ activated vit D analogue
- calcimimetics eg cinacalcet; used to treat refractory inc PTH and inc PTH in combination w/ inc Ca2+
- bisphophonates can be given if clinically indicated and eGFR >=30

restless legs/cramps
- exclude iron deficiency as possible exacerbating factor
- sleep hygiene
- treatment for severe cases w/ gabapentin/pregabalin/dopamine agonists if off licence: beware of SE (falls, cognitive impairment)

diet
- expert dietary advice should be available regarding phosphate restriction and K+ if hyperkaelamic, whilst avoiding malnutrition

**management of cardiovascular risk in CVD**
- cvd confers inc risk of CVD due to inc BP, vascular stiffness, inflammation, oxidative stress, and abnormal endothelial function
- CV risk often higher than risk of kidney failure
- consider antiplatelets (low-dose aspirin) if risk for atherosclerotic events, unless bleeding risk outweighs benefit (mortality benefit unclear in CKD)
- atorvastatin 20mg (higher dose if GFR >30) for primary and secondary prevention of CVD (no consistent benefit demonstrated for pts on dialysis)
- SGLT2 inhibitors if eGFR >25 + indicated for CVD or heart failure
- CKD should not affect treatment for HF but inc monitoring of GFR and K+
- GFR <60 may affect troponin and BNP concentrations; interpret results cautiously

**preparation for renal replacement therapy (RRT)**
- planning for RRT should begin in progressive CKD when clinical judgement predicts that RRT wll be required w/in 12 months
- shared decision making, psychological preparation, work-up for transplantation, modality choice, and access take time
- all suitable pts should be informed about advantages of pre-emptive living kidney transplant and effort made to find a donor
- all suitable pts w/o donor should be listed for deceased donor transplantation 6 months before anticipated start of RRT

## Prescribing
- never prescribe in kidney disease w/o checking how administration should be altered due to dec GFR
- determined largely by extent to which drug excreted by kidney
- significant aminoglycosides, penicillins, cephalosporins, heparin, lithium, opiates, and digoxin
- loading doses should not be changed
- if precision required for dosing then GFR should not be estimated from creatinine and standard reference measure should be used: inulin, 51Cr-EDTA, 125I-iothalamate, iohexol
- if pt recieving RRT (haemofiltrated, peritoneal, or haemodialysis), dose modification depends on extent to which drug is cleared from circulation by dialysis/filtration
- consult drug database/pharmacist
