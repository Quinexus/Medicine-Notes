# Nephrotic Syndrome

## Background
triad of: 
- proteinuria >3g/24h (UPCR >300mg/mmnol, UACR >250mg/mmol); 
- hypoalbuminaemia (usually <30g/L can be 10g/L)
- oedema

aetiology:
- primary kidney disease: minimal change, membranous nephropathy (may be assoc w/ underlying inflammation/malignancy), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), mebranoproliferative GN
- secondary kidney disease: DM, lupus, myeloma, amyloid, pre-eclampsia

pathophysiology
- filtration barrier: podocytes, glomerular BM, endothelial cells
- proteinuria
    - podocyte pathology: abnormal function in minimal change disease, immnue-mediated damage in membranous nephropathy, podocyte injury/death in FSGS
    - GBM/endothelial cell pathology: membranoproliferative GN, inherited abnormalities in membrane proteins causing disease (Alport's) or treatment resitance

## Presentation
- generalised pitting oedema can be rapid & severe: check dependent areas (ankles if mobile, sacral pad/elbows if bed-bound) and areas of low tissue resistance e.g. periorbitally
- history: systemic symptoms, consider malignancy & chronic infection
- ddx: CCF (inc JVP, pulmonary oedema), liver disease (dec albumin)

## Diagnosis
- adults kidney biopsy if cause unclear, may not be indicated if DM + microvascular complications, positive PLA2-R
- histology may direct disease-sepecific treatment
- minimal change most common - steroids for remission in majority
- biopsy avoided in children unless steroid resistent or atypical features: age <1yr, family history, extrarenal disease, kidney failure, haematuria

## Management
1. Reduce oedema: 
    - fluid and salt restriction
    - diuresis w/ loop diuretics; give IV if oral absorption affected
    - use daily weights to guide - aim 0.5-2kg loss per fay depending on severity/size to try and avoid intravascluar volume depletion and secondary AKI
    - thiazides added if resistant
    - albumin infusion inc proteinuria - data shows benefits outcomes limited
2. Treat underlying cause
    - biopsy/histology
    - diuresis may be required first if orthopnoea or subcutaneous oedema at biopsy site
    - minimal change most common - steroids for remission in majority
3. Reduce proteinuria
    - ACE-i/ARB (may not be needed in minimal change if response is rapid)
    - SGLT2 in proteinuric CKD: eGFR >25 + UACR >25
4. Complications
    - thromboembolism:
        - hypercoagulable due to inc clotting factors, dec anti-thrombin III, and platelet abnormalities
        - inc risk of VTE, inc DVT/PE (~10% adult pts) and renal vein thrombosis (loin pain, haematuria, inc LDH, AKI if b/l)
        - if low bleeding risk, consider prophylaxis when albumin <25
    - infection:
        - urine losses of immunoglobulins and immune mediators -> inc risk urinary, respiratory and CNS infections
        - fluid accumulation areas: cellulitis, peritonitis, empyema
        - ensure pneumococcal vaccine given
        - inc risk of varicella w/ steroid treatment: post-exposure prophylaxis in non-immune, do not give live vaccine if immunosuppressed
    - hyperlipidaemia:
        - inc cholesterol (often >10), inc LDL, inc triglycerides, dec HDL
        - inc hepatic synthesis in response to dec oncotic pressure and defective lipid breakdown
        - proportional to proteinuria
        - benefits of statins in CKD are extrapolated to nephrotic syndrome where there is dec evidence
