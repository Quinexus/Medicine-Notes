# Membranous Nephropathy

## Background
~25% adult nephrotic syndrome

aetiology
- primary
    - anti-phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2-R) in 70-80%
    - thrombospondin type 1 domain-containing 7A antibodies in 3-5%
- secondary
    - malignancy: lung, breast, GI, prostate, haematological
    - infection: hepatitis B/C, Streptococcus, malaria, schistomiasis
    - immunological: SLE, RA, sarcoidosis, Sjogren
    - drugs: gold, penicillamine


## Presentation

## Diagnosis
- PLA2-R antibody concentrations are prognostic
- biopsy: diffusely thickened GBM, subepithelial deposits (IgG4 dominant in idiopathic, other IgGs in secondary disease)
- 'spikes' on silver stain where GBM grows between deposits

## Management
indolent disease w/ spontaneous complete remission in ~20%, partial in 20%

- ACE-i/ARB, blood pressure control and lipid management
- SGLT2 inhibitor
- consider VTE prophylaxis if albumin <25
- observe for spontaneous remission
- immunosuppression for high-risk primary disease; options: rituximab, alternating steroids/cytotoxics for 6 mnts (ponticelli regimen), steroids + calcineurin inhibitors
- PLA2-R conc correlate w/ disease activity
- treat underlying cause if secondary
