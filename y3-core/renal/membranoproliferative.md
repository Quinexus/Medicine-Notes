# Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis

## Background
~10% adult nephrotic syndrome (higher in low-/middle-income countries due to infection)

aetiology
- immune-complex associated: increase/abnormal immune complexes deposit in kidney and activate complement; underlying cause found in most adult cases (e.g. infection, cryoglobulinaemia, monoclonal gammopathy, autoimmunity)
- c3 glomerulopathy: due to genetic or acquired defect in alternative complement (e.g. C3 nephritic factor); progressive kidney disease common

## Presentation

## Diagnosis
- proliferative glomerulonephritis w/ electron-dense deposits
- immunoglobulin deposition distinguishes immune-complex associated disease from C3 glomerulonephropathy

## Treatment
- ACE/ARB and blood pressure control in all
- SGLT2i
- expert evaluation of complement pathways may offer utility in tailoring treatment according to aetiology
- underlying cause in immune-complex disease
- targeted C3 therapies awaited
