# Minimal Change Disease

## Background
~25% of adult nephrotic syndrome

aetiology: idiopathic (most), rarely w/ drugs (NSAIDs, lithium), or paraneoplastic (haematological malignancy, usually Hodgkin's lymphoma)

does not cause kidney failure (if CKD consider missed FSGS)

## Presentation

## Diagnosis
- light microscopy is normal
- electron microscopy shows effacement of podocyte foot processes (non-specific finding in proteinuria)

## Management
prednisolone 1mg/kg 
- 75% of adults will respond w/in 16 wks
- >50% relapse, may need longer-term immunosuppression

alternative tacrolimus for both de novo and relapse
