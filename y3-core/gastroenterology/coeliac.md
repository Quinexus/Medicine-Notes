# Coeliac Disease
Intolerance to gluten leading to abdo symptoms

## Background
- 95% DQ2, rest DQ8; autoimmune diseases
- 1 in 100-300 (commoner if Irish); any age (peaks in childhood & 50-60ysr); 1:1=M:F; 6x if 1st degree FH
- TCR response to gluten
- gluten = wheat, barley, rye +/- oats
- causes villous atrophy

## Presentation
? if diarrhoea + weight loss or anaemia (iron/B12)
- ABDO Sx: steatorrhoea, diarrhoea, pain, bloating, N&V, aphthous ulcers, angular stomatitis
- systemic: weight loss, fatigue, weakness, osteomalacia
- children: failure to thrive ~30%
- DDx IBS in less severe cases

- complications
    - anaemia
    - ostoepenia/porosis
    - hyposplenism
    - T cell lymphoma (rare, ? in refractory or dec weight)
    - inc malignancy (lymphoma, gastric, oesophageal, colorectal)
    - neuropathies

## Diagnosis
- dec Hb, inc RCDW, dec B12, dec ferritin
- Ab: anti-TTG (check IgA deficiency)
- Ab postivie or high suspicion -> duodenal biopsy on gluten diet
- biopsy: subtotal villous atrophy, inc intra-epithelial WBCs + crypt hyperplasia
- doubts then DQ2/8 genotype

## Management
- lifelong gluten free diet
- monitor response by symptoms and repeat serology
- offer flu and pneumococcal vaccines (risk of hyposplenism)
