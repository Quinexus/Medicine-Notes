# Primary Biliary Cholangitis
interlobular bile ducts are damaged to chronic autoimmune granulomatous inflammation causing cholestasis -> fibrosis, cirrhosis, and portal HTN

## Background
cause
- unknown environmental triggers (?pollutants, xenobiotics, non-pathogenic bacteria)
- + genetic predisposition
- leading to loss of immune tolerance to self-mitochondrial proteins

prevalence: <4/100,000; F:M~9:1
age at presentation: ~50

risk inc
- FH (1-6%)
- many UTIs
- smoking
- past pregnancy
- other autoimmune disease
- inc use of nail polish/hair dye

## Presentation
- often asymptomatic and diagnosed after incidental finding inc ALP
- lethargy, sleepiness, and pruritis may precede jaundice by years
- signs
  - jaundice
  - skin pigmentation
  - xanthelasma
  - xanthomata
  - hepatosplenomegaly
- complications
  - cirrhosis
  - osteoporosis common
  - malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins (ADEK) due to cholestasis and dec bilirubin in gut lumen -> osteomalacia and coagulopathy
  - HCC

## Diagnosis
antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) - hallmark of PBC

- blood
  - inc ALP, inc GGT, and mildly inc AST & ALT
  - late disease: inc bilirubin, dec albumin, inc PT
  - 9t% AMA M2 subtype +ve
  - other autoantibodies may occur in low titres
  - immunoglobulins are inc
  - TSH & cholesterol inc or normal
- US: exclude extrahepatic cholestasis
- biopsy: usually not needed (unless drug-induced cholestasis or hepatic sarcoidosis need excluding) -> lf granulomas around bile ducts +/- cirrhosis

## Management
- symptomatic
  - pruritis: try colestyramine; naltrexone and rifampicin may also help
  - diarrhoea: codeine phosphate
  - osteoporosis prevention
- specific
  - fat-soluble vitamin prophylaxis
  - high-dose ursodeoxycholic acid w/ meals and at bedtime = only recommended medication at condition itself, may improve survival and delay transplantation; SE: inc weight
  - obeticholic acid can be added if response is deemed inadequate
- monitoring
  - regular LFT
  - USS +/- AFP twice-yearly if cirrhotic
- liver transplantation
  - for end-stage disease or intractable pruritis
  - histological recurrance in graft: ~17% after 5yrs
  - although graft failure can occur as result of recurrence, it is rare and unpredictable
- prognosis
  - highly variable
  - Mayo survival model (predict survival): age, bilirubin, albumin, PT time, oedema, and need for diuretics
