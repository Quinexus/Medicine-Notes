# Irritable Bowel Syndrome
chronic functional disorder of the GI tract characterised by recurrent abdominal pain associated w/ altered bowel habits

## Background
- pathophysiology: unknown, but likely involves
  - intestinal motility
  - visceral hypersensitivity
  - intestinal inflammation
  - microbial dysbiosis
- prevalence
  - 10-20% but depends on criteria used
  - age at onset: <~40%
  - F:M >= 2:1

## Diagnosis
symptom-based criteria but symptoms are not specific for IBS, therefore must use frequency and duration to distinguish from transient gut symptoms

Rome IV criteria: recurrent abdo pain >=1 day/wk on average in last 3mnths, associated w/ >=2 of:
- relieved or worsened by defecation
- altered stool frequency
- altered stool form

other features:
- urgency
- incomplete evacuation
- abdominal bloating/distension
- mucus PR
- worsening symptoms after food
- symptoms are chronic (onset >=6mnths prior to diagnosis), and often exacerbated by stress, menstruation, or gastroenteritis (post-infectious IBS)

subtypes
- IBS-C predominant constipation
- IBS-D predominant diarrhoea
- IBS-M mixed
- unclassified

signs
- examination usually normal
- mild abdo tenderness common 
- insufflation of air during lower GI endoscopy (not usually needed) may reproduce pain

associated conditions
- presence of other functional bowel disorders eg functional dyspepsia
- other associated conditions: migraine, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, depression, dyspareunia

when to investigate
- rarely required when criteria are met and alarm features are absent
- FBC, CRP or faecal calprotectin, and coeliac serology in IBS-D & IBS-M are sufficient
- colonscopy in presence of alarm features
  - age of onset >50yrs
  - history <6mnths
  - unexplained dec weight or anaemia
  - nocturnal diarrhoea
  - FH of IBD/CRC
  - abnormal CRP/ESR

refer if
- diagnostic uncertainity
- changing symptoms in 'known IBS'
- refractory to management

## Management

inital
- based on type and severity of symptoms
- all pts given positive diagnosis, explanation of condition, reassurance of benign natural history
- pts w/ mild intermittent symptoms, lifestyle/dietary measures are sufficient
- non-fatal, safety of treatment is priority

lifestyle: exercise (inverse association w/ colonic transient time), stress reduction, and sleep hygiene

dietary modification: take careful dietary history; much of evidence between food triggers is weak but some specific dietary interventions may be recommended under dietician supervision:
1. low FODMAP (fermentable carbohydrates; poorly absorbed and gas producing) diet, but stop if no improvement after 1 month of strict adherence
2. fibre supplementation; potential benefits are restricted to soluble fibres (psyllium/ispaghula), avoid increasing wheat bran intake
3. dietary exclusions; spicy foods and excess fat if these are triggers, gluten-free diet not recommended
4. probiotics; 1-month trials can be considered, but not provide substantial benefit

pharmcotherapy
- IBS-C: ?response soluble fibres, none -> osmotic laxatives (polyethelene glycol > lactulose = can aggrevate bloating); if fails -> prosecretory agents linaclotide, prucalopride or plecanatide
- IBS-D: try loperamide before meals
- colic/bloating: oral antispasmodics - mebeverine or hyoscine butylbromide (OTC)
- psychological symptoms/visceral hypersensitivity: emphasise positive
  - excluded sinister pathology
  - over time symptoms improve
  - consider behavioural therapy, hypnosis, tricyclics (low dose for visceral pain not depression and that it improves IBS-D by slowing GI transit)
