in liver failure
- nitrogenous waste (as ammonia) builds up in circulation -> brain
- astrocytes clear it - conversion of glutamate to glutamine
- excess glutamine causes osmotic imbalance and shift of fluid into cells -> cerebral oedema

2. increasing drowsiness, confusion, slurred speech +/- liver flap, inappropriate behaviour/personality change
