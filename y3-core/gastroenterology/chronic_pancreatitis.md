# Chronic Pancreatitis

## Background
causes
- alcohol
- smoking
- autoimmune
- rare: familial, CF, haemachromatosis, pancreatic duct obstruction (stones/tumour), congenital (pancreas divisium)

## Presentation
epigastrium pain 'bores' through to back
- relived by sitting forward or hot water bottles on epigastrium/back (look for skin mottling of erythema ab igne)
- bloating 
- steatorrhoea
- dec weight
- DM
symptoms relapse and worsen

complications
- pseudocyst
- diabetes
- biliary obstruction
- local arterial aneurysm
- splenic vein thrombosis
- gastric varices
- pancreatic carcinoma

## Diagnosis
- US +/- CT: pancreatic calcifications confirm diagnosis
- MRCP
- AXR: speckled calcifications
- faecal elastase

##Â Management
- drugs
  - give analgesia (coeliac-plexus block may give relief)
  - lipase
  - eg Creon; fat-soluble vitamins
  - insulin needs may be high or variable (beware hypoglycaemia)
- diet
  - no alcohol
  - low fat may help
  - medium-chain triglycerides (MCT oil) may be tried
  - (no lipase needed for absorption, but diarrhoea may be worsened)
- surgery
  - for unremitting pain
  - narcotic abuse
  - dec weight
  - pancreatectomy or pancreaticojejunostomy (a duct drainage procedure)
