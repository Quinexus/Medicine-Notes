# Autoimmune Hepatitis
inflammatory liver disease of unknown cause characterised by abnormal T-cell function and autoantibodies against hepatocyte surface antigens

## Background
classification by autoantibodies
- I
  - 80%
  - typical: F <40; F:M~4:1
  - ANA +ve in ~70% w/ titres >1:160
  - antismooth muscle antibodies (ASMA) +ve in upto 90% but poorly specific
  - inc IgG in 97%
  - good response to immunosuppression in 80%
  - 25% have cirrhosis at presentation
- II
  - europe > usa
  - F:M~10:1
  - more often in children and more commonly progresses to cirrhosis and less treatable
  - typically anti-liver/kidney microsomal type 1 (LKM1) antibodies +ve
  - ASMA and AMA typically -ve

- predominantly young/middle-aged women (bimodal)

associations:
- pernicious anaemia
- ulcerative colitis
- glomerulonephritis
- autoimmune thyroiditis
- autoimmune haemolysis
- diabetes mellitus
- PSC
- HLA A1, B8 and DR3 haplotype

## Presentation
- upto 40% present w/ acute hepatitis and signs of autoimmune disease
- remainder present w/ gradual jaundice or are asymptomatic and diagnosed incidentally w/ signs of chronic liver disease
- amenorrhoea is common and disease tends to attenuate during pregnancy

complications: associated w/ cirrhosis and drug therapy

## Diagnosis
- tests
  - serum bilirubin, AST, ALT, and ALP all usually inc,
  - hypergammaglobulinaemia
  - +ve autoantibodies
  - anaemia, dec WCC, and dec platelets indicate hypersplenism
- liver biopsy
  - mononuclear infiltrate of portal and periportal areas and piecemeal necrosis +/- fibrosis
  - cirrhosis ~ worse prognosis
  - MRCP: helps exclude PSC if ALP inc disproportionately
  
- excluding other disease (no test is pathognomic)
- diagnostic criteria based on IgG levels, autoantibodies, and histology in absence of viral disease are helpful
- sometimes diagnosis  is challenge - overlap w/ other chronic liver disease: eg PBC, PSC, and chronic viral hepatitis

##Â Management
- immunosuppressant therapy
  - prednisolone for 1 month; dec 5mg a month to maintenance dose
  - steroids can be stopped after 2 yrs but relapse occurs in 50-86%
  - azathioprine may be used as steroid-sparing agent to maintain remission
  - remission achievable in 80% of pts w/in 3yrs
  - 10-20yr survival rates are >80%, SE big problem made better by budesonide switch 
- liver transplantation
  - indicated for decompensated cirrhosis or if there is failure to respond to medical therapy, but recurrance may occur
  - effective (actuarial 10yr survival is 75%)

prognosis
- appears not to matter whether sympatomatic or asympatomatic at presentation (10yr survival ~80% for both)
- presence of cirrhosis reduces 10yr survival from 94% -> 62%
- overlap syndromes:  AIH-PBC overalp is worse than AIH-AIC (autoimmune cholangitis)
