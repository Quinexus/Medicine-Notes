# Cirrhosis

## Background
- implies irreversible liver damage
- histology: loss of normal hepatic architecture w/ bridging fibrosis and nodular regeneration

causes
- most often fatty liver disease (chronic alcohol use and non-alcoholic)
- HBV or HCV infection

## Presentation
- leuconychia: white nails w/ lunulae undemarcated, from hypoalbuminaemia
- terry's nails: white proximally but distal 1/3 reddened by telangiectasis
- clubbing
- palmar erythema
- hyperdynamic circulation
- Dupuytren's contracture
- spider naevi
- xanthelasma
- gynaecomastia
- atrophic testes
- loss of body hair
- parotid enlargement
- hepatomegaly or small liver in late disease
- ascites
- splenomegaly

complications
- hepatic failure
  - coagulopathy (hepatic syn of clotting factors)
  - encephalopathy
  - hypoalbuminaemia (oedema)
  - sepsis: pneumonia, septicaemia
  - spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
  - hypoglycaemia
- portal hypertension
  - ascites
  - splenomegaly
  - portosystemic shunt inc oesophageal varices (+/- life-threatening upper GI bleed)
  - caput medusae (enlarged superficial periumbilical veins)
  - inc risk HCC

## Presentation
- blood
  - LFT
    - normal or inc bilirubin, inc AST, inc ALT, inc ALP, inc GGT
    - later w/ loss of synthetic function 
    - look for dec albumin +/- inc PT/INR
  - dec WCC & dec platelets = hypersplenism
  - cause
    - ferritin, iron/TIBC
    - hepatitis serology
    - immunoglobulins
    - autoantibodies: ANA, AMA, SMA
    - b-fetoprotein
    - caeruloplasmin in pts <40yrs
    - b1-antitrypsin
- liver US + duplex
  - small liver of hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, focal liver lesions, hepatic vein thrombus, reversed flow in portal vein or ascites
  - MRI: inc caudate lobe size, smaller islands of regenerating nodules, and presence of R posterior hepatic notch are more frequent in alcoholic cirrhosis than in virus-induced cirrhosis
- ascitic tap: should be performed & fluid sent for urgent MC+S - neutrophils >250 indicates SBP
- liver biopsy: confirms clinical diagnosis

## Management
- general
  - good nutrition vital
  - alcohol abstinence
  - avoid NSAIDs, sedatives, and opiates
  - colestyramine helps pruritis
  - consider US + b-fetoprotein every 6mnths to screen HCC
- specific
  - hepatitis-induced cirrhosis
  - PBC: urso
  - Wilson: penicillamine
- ascites
  - fluid restriction
  - low-salt diet
  - spironolactone - counters deranged RAA axis
  - chart daily weight and aim loss <=1/2kg/d
  - ?poor response -> furosemide and U+E often
  - therapeutic paracentesis w/ concomitant albumin infusion (6-8g/L fluid removed)
- spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
  - any pt w/ ascites who deteriorates suddenly (may be asymptomatic)
  - common organisms: E. coli, Klebsiella, and streptococci
  - Rx: piptaz or until sensitivies known
  - prophylaxis for high-risk pts: dec albumin, inc PT/INR, low ascitic albumin or those who have had a previous episode
- encephalopathy: recurrent episodes may be reduced in freq w/ prophylactic lactulose and rifaximin
- renal failure: dec hepatic clearance of immune complexes -> trapping in kidneys (therefore IgA nephropathy +/- hepatic glomerulosclerosis)

prognosis
- overall 5yr survival ~50%
- poor prognostic indicators
  - encephalopathy
  - serum Na <110
  - serum albumin <25
  - inc INR

liver transplantation: only definitive treatment for cirrhosis
- acute indications: King's College criteria
- chronic indications: advanced cirrhosis of any causeor HCC (1 nodule <5cm or <=5 nodules <3cm)
  - chronic alcohol use
  - chronic HBV/HCV infection
  - non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)
  - genetic disorders: haemochromatosis, a1-antitrypsin deficiency, wilson's
  - hepatic vein events (Budd-Chiari)
  - autoimmunity: PBC, PSC, AIH
  - drugs: eg amiodarone, methyldopa, methotrexate
