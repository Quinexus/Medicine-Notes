# Liver Failure

## Background
- development of coagulopathy (INR >1.5) and encephalopathy
- may occur suddenly in previously healthy liver = acute liver failure
  - hyperacute = <=7d
  - acute = 8-21d
  - subacute = 4-26wks
- most commonly on background of cirrhosis = chronic liver failure
- fulminant hepatic failure = massive necrosis of liver cells

causes
- infections: viral hepatitis, yellow fever, leptospirosis
- drugs: paracetamol, halothane, isoniazid
- toxins: Amanita phalloides mushroom, carbon tetrachloride
- vascular: budd-chiari syn, veno-occlusive disease
- others: alcohol, fatty liver disease, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, haemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis beta-1-antitypsin deficiency, wilson's disease, fatty liver of pregnancy, malignancy

##Â Presentation
- jaundice
- hepatic encephalopahty
- fetor hepaticus (smells like pear drops)
- asterixis/flap
- constructional apraxia
signs of chronic liver disease suggest acute-on-chronic hepatic failure

## Diagnosis
- blood: FBC (?infection, ?GI bleed), U+E, LFT, clotting (inc PT/INR), glucose, paracetamol level, hepatitis, CMV and EBV serology, ferritin, b1-antitrypsin, caeruloplasmin, autoantibodies
- microbiology: blood culture, urine culture
  - ascitic tap for MC&S of ascites - neutrophils >250/mm indicates spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
- radiology: CXR, abdo US, doppler flow studies of portal vein (and hepatic vein in Budd-Chiari syndrome)
- neurophysiology: EEG, evoked potentials (and neuroimaging) have limited role

king's college hospital criteria in acute liver failure: predicts poor outcome and consider for transplantation
- paracetamol-induced liver failure
  - arterial pH <7.3 24h after ingestion
  - or all of the following
    - PT >100s
    - creatinine >300
    - grade III or IV encephalopathy
- non-paracetamol liver failure
  - PT > 1000s
  - or 3 out of 5 following
    1. drug-induced liver failure
    2. age <10 or >40yrs old
    3. >1wk from 1st jaundice to encephalopathy
    4. PT >50s
    5. bilirubin >=300

## Management
!! Beware sepsis, hypo, GI bleeds/varices & encephalopathy

- nurses w/ 20o head-up tilt in ITU; protect airway w/ intubation and insert NGT to avoid aspiration and remove blood from stomach
- insert urinary & central-venous catheters to help assess fluid status
- monitor To, respirations, pulse, BP, pupils, urine output hourly; daily weights
- check FBC, U+E, LFT, and INR daily
- 10% glucose IV, 1L/12h to avoid hypoglycaemia; do blood glucose every 1-4h
- treat cause if known
- if malnourished, get dietary help: good nutrition can decrease mortality; give B1 and B9 supplements
- treat seizures w/ phenytoin
- haemofiltration or haemodialysis, if renal failure develops
- try to avoid sedatives and other drugs w/ hepatic metabolism
- consider PPI as prophylaxis against stress ulceration
- liaise early w/ nearest transplant centre regarding appropriateness

treat complications
- cerebral oedema: on ITU 20% mannitol IV, hyperventilate
- ascites: restrict fluid, low-salt diet, weigh daily, diuretics
- bleeding: vit K 10mg/d IV for 3d, platelets, FFP + blood as needed +/- endoscopy
- blind Rx infection: ceftriaxone 1-2g/24h IV not gentamicin (inc risk of renal failure)
- dec blood gluose: ? <2mmol/L or symptomatic, Rx 50mL of 50% glucose IV, check often
- encephalopathy
  - avoid sedatives
  - 20o head-up tilt in ITU
  - correct electrolytes
  - lactulose is catabolised by bacterial flora to short-chain fatty acids which dec colonic pH and trpa NH3 in colon as NH4+
  - rifaximin non-absorbable oral antibiotics that dec numbers of nitrogen-forming gut bacteria

prognosis worse if:
- grade III-IV encephalopathy
- age >40yrs
- albumin <30
- inc INR
- drug-induced liver failure
- late-onset hepatic failure
- worse than fulminant failure

prescribing
- avoid drugs that constipate - inc risk of encephalopathy
- oral hypoglycaemics
- saline-containing IVIS
- warfarin effects are enhanced
- hepatotoxic drugs include: paracetamol, methotrexate, isoniazid, azathioprine, phenothiazines, oestrogen, 6-mercaptopurine, salicylates, tetracycline, mitomycin
