# Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis
progressive cholestasis w/ bile duct inflammation and strictures

##Â Background
associations
- M sex
- HLA-A1;B8;DR3
- AIH; >80% of northern european also have IBD, usually UC; this combination is associated w/ inc risk of colorectal malignancy

cancers
- bile duct
- gallbladder
- liver
- colon cancers
- more common -> yrly colonoscopy + US
- consider cholecystectomy for gallbladder polyps

## Presentation
pruritis +/- fatigue
if advanced: ascending cholangitis, cirrhosis, and hepatic failure

## Diagnosis
- inc ALP -> inc bilirubin
- hypergammaglobulinaemia
- and/or in IgM
- AMA -ve but ANA, SMA, and ANCA may be +ve
- ERCP/MRCP reveal duct anatomy and damage
- liver biopsy shows fibrous, obliverative cholangitis

## Management
- liver transplant mainstay end-stage disease
- recurrence occurs in upto 30%
- 5yr graft survival is >60%
- prognosis worse for those w/ IBD as 5-10% develop CRC post-transplant
- endoscopic therapy to dilate dilate/stent strictures
- ursodeoxycholic acid may improve LFT but has not shown evidence of survival benefit; high doses may be harmful
- colestyramine for pruritis (naltrexone and rifampicin may help)
- Abx for bacterial cholangitis
