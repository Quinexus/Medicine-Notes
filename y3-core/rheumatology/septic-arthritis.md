# Septic Arthritis

## Background
risk factors
- pre-existing joint disease (esp RA)
- diabetes
- immunosuppression
- chronic renal failure
- recent joint, dental, or other surgery
- presence of indwelling catheters or lines
- prosthetic joints (where infection is particularly difficult to treat)
- IVDU
- age >80


- common causative organisms: Staph aureus, streptococci, Neisseria gonococcus, and Gram -ve bacilli

## Presentation
- ! consider in any acutely inflammed joint -> destroy joint in <24h and mortality upto 11%
- inflammation less overt if immunocompromised or if there is underlying joint disease or in very elderly
- knee affected > 50% cases

## Diagnosis
- urgent joint aspiration for synovial fluid microscopy and culture
- XR and CRP may be normal
- ddx: crystal arthropathies
- blood cultures essential (prior to antibiotics)

how did the organism get there?
- ?immunosuppression
- ?infection focus eg IV lines, infected skin, abscess, meningococcal disease or pneumonia

## Management
- ?septic arthritis -> empirical IV Abx (after aspiration)
- focal local guidelines for Abx choice and contact micro for advice for all complex and immunosuppressed pts
- consder fluclox; vanc IV + 2nd/3rd gen ceph
- 2nd/3rd gen ceph if gram -ve suspected
- for ?gonococcus or meningococcus consider ceftriaxone
- Abx required for prolonged period - ~2wks IV -> if improving 2-4wks PO
- consider orthopaedic review for arthrocentesis, washout and debridement
! always urgent refer pts w/ prosthetic joint involvement
