# Rheumatoid arthritis medications

Control over-produced cytokines and cellular process that erode cartilage and bone

DMARDs
- 1st line, started 3mnths of persistent symptoms
- take 6-12wks for symptomatic benefit
- best results use combination of methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroqiure or lefluonamide
- SEs
    - immunosuppression: potentially fatal (esp combination w/ methotrexate) -> pancytopenia, inc susceptibility to infection (inc atypicals), & neutropenic sepsis;  regular FBC, LFT monitoring
    - methotrexate: pneumonitis (pre-treatment CXR), oral ulcers, hepatotoxicity
    - sulfasalazine: rash, dec sperm count, oral ulcers, GI upset
    - leflunomide: teratogenicity (M&F), oral ulcers, inc BP, hepatatoxicity
    - hydroxychloroquine: retinopathy (pre-treatment & annual eye screen required)

Biological DMARDs: specialists only, pts w/ active disease despite at least 2 convential DMARDs; pre-treatment screening for TB, hep B/C, HIV essential
- TNFa-inhibitors (infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab): monotherapy where methotrexate contraindicated
- B-cell depletion (rituximab): combinatioon w/ methotrexate and NICE approved for severe active RA
- IL-1 & IL-6 inhibitors (tocilizumab): NICE approved for combination w/ methotrexate where TNFa blocker failed/contraindicated; monitor for hypercholesterolaemia & hepatoxicity
- T-cell co-stimulation inhibition (abatacept): licensed for active RA where pts not responded to DMARDs/TNFa blocker

Targeted synthetic DMARDs: Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors
- e.g. tofacitinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib
- inhibit signalling through cytokine receptors
- oral
- NICE approved for combination w/ methotrexate for severe (DAS28 >5.1) active RA upresponse to DMARDs inc >=1 biologic

SE for biologics and targeted synthetics
- serious infection; TB reactivation (screen and consider prophylaxis); hep B
- worsening HF
- hypersensitivity; injcetion site reaction
- blood disorders
- ANA and reversible SLE-type illness
- no increased solid organ tumours but skin cancers may be more common
- JAK-inhibitors inc risk CVD cf other DMARDs
