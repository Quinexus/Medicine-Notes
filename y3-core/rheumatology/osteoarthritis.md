# Osteoarthritis

## Background
- most common joint prob worldwide, >10% 60+
- aetiology: primary (generalised) most common but can be secondary to inflammatory joint disorders or others
- RFs: obesity, trauma, occupation, sport, congenital anatomical abnormality

## Presentation
- localised knee/hip: 
    - pain
    - crepitus on movement
    - background rest ache, worse with activity
    - joints may 'gel' (brief stiffness after rest, ~10-15mins)
    - unstable joints, lack of power due to pain
- generalised 'nodal OA' (DIP, PIP, CMC, & knees post menopause)
    - joint tenderness, derangement, bony swelling (Heberden DIP, Bouchard PIP)
    - reduced ROM
    - mild synovitis
    - first CMC arthritis in absence of nodes -> often superadded knee and spinal disease

## Diagnosis
plain radiograph: LOSS
    - Loss of joint space
    - Osteophytes
    - Subarticular sclerosis
    - Subchondral cysts

## Management
assess effect on occupation, family duties, hobbies and lifestyle expectations

- core: exercise to improve local muscle strength and general aerobic fitness + weight loss if overweight
- analgesia: paracetamol +/- topical NSAIDs -> codeine or short-term oral NSAIDs (+PPI)
    - other: topical capsaicin
    - intra-articular injections: steroids (temporary relief), hyaluronic acid injections (viscosupplementation) are not approved
    - glucosamine and chondroitin not recommended
- non-pharma: MDT w/ PTOT; heat/cold packs, walking aids, stretching/manipulation, or TENS
- surgery: joint replacement for severe OA w/ impact on QoL
