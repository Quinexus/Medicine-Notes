# Ankylosing Spondylitis
chronic inflammatory disease of spine and sacroiliac joints, of unknown aetiology

## Background
- 0.5-1% prevalance
- men present earler
- m:f~6:1 at 16 ~2:1 at 30
- ~90% HLA-B27 +ve

## Presentation
- gradual onset low back pain
- worse during night w/ spinal morning stiffness
- radiates from sacroiliac joints -> hips/buttock and improves towards end of day
- progressive loss of spinal movements (all directions) - hence dec thoracic expansion

- disease course variable: few kyphosis, neck hyperextension ('question mark' posture) and spino-cranial ankylosis
- other features
  - enthesitis: esp achilles tendonitis and plantar fasciitis
  - anterior mechanical CP due to costochondritis
  - acute iritis in ~1/3 -> blindness if untreated 
  - assoc: osteoporosis (upto 60%), aortic valve incompetence (<3%), and pulmonary apical fibrosis  

## Diagnosis
- clinical diagnosis supported w/ imaging
- MRI active inflammation (bone marrow oedema) as well as destructive changes: erosions, sclerosis, and ankylosis
- XR: SI joint narrowing/widening, sclerosis, erosions, and ankylosis/fusion
- vertebral syndesmophytes: bony proliferations due to enthesitis between ligaments and vertebra -> fuse w/ vertebral body above -> ankylosis
- later stages: calcification of ligaments w/ ankylosis -> 'bamboo spine' appearance
- also: FBC (normocytic anaemia), inc ESR, inc CRP

## Management
- exercise, not rest, for backache, including intense exercise regimens to maintain posture and mobility - ideally w/ specialist physio
- NSAIDs symptom relief w/in 48h and may slow radiographic progression
- TNF-a blockers for severe AS
- IL-17 inhibitors effective and approved by NICE in pts w/ inadequate response, avoided in pts w/ coexisting IBD (exacerbate IBD)
- local steroid injections for temporary relief
- surgery: hip replacement to improve pain and mobility if hips involves and rarely spinal osteotomy
- inc risk of osteoporotic fractures: consider bisphosphonates

prognosis
- no clear relationship between activity of arthritis and severity of underlying inflammation (all spondyloarthritis)
- prognosis worse: ESR >30, onset <16 days, early hip involvement, poor response to NSAIDs
