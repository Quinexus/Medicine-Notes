# Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)
multisystemic autoimmune disease

## Background
- autoantibodies made against variety of autoantigens -> form immune complexes
- inadequate clearance of immune complexes -> immune responses -> inflammation and damage
- environmental triggers

prevalence
- ~0.2%
- F:M ~ 9:1
- typically women of child-bearing age
- commoner in african caribbeans, asians, and if HLA-B8, DR2, DR3 +ve
- ~10% pts have 1st- or 2nd-degree relative w/ SLE

drug-induced lupus
- causes: isoniazid, hydralazine (if >50mg/24h in slow acetylators), procainamide, quinidine, chlorpromazine, minocycline, phenytoin, anti-TNF agents
- assoc w/ antihistone antibodies in >95%
- skin and lung signs prevail (renal and CNS rarely affected)
- disease remits if drug stopped
- sulfonamides or oral contraceptive pill may worsen idiopathic SLE

## Presentation
- remitting and relapsing illness of variable presentation and course
- features often non-specific (malaise, fatigue, myalgia, and fever) or organ-specific and caused by active inflammation or damage
- other features: lymphadenopathy, weight loss, alopecia, nail-fold infarcts, non-infective endocarditis (Libman-Sacks syndrome), Raynaud's (30%), stroke, and retinal exudates

## Diagnosis
immunology
- >95% are ANA+ve
- hight anti-dsDNA antibody titre is highly specific, but only +ve in ~60% of cases
- ENA maybe +ve in 20-30% (anti-Ro, anti-La,  anti-Sm, anti-RNP)
- 40% RHF +ve
- antiphospholiipid antibodies (anticardiolipin or lupus anticoagulant) may also be +ve
- SLE may be associated with other autoimmune conditions
  - Sjogren (15-20%)
  - autoimmune thyroid disease (5-10%)
  - antibodies to C1Q associated w/ renal disease primarily in lupus, but can also occur in hypocomplementaemic urticarial vasculitis (HUVS)

systemic lupus international collorating clinics classifications
- diagnose SLE in appropriate clinical setting if >=4 criteria (at least 1 clinical and 1 laboratory) or biopsy-proven lupus nephritis w/ positive ANA or anti-DNA
- clinical criteria
  1. acute cutaenous lupus: malar rash/butterfly
     - fixed erythema, flat or raised, over malar eminences, tending to spare the nasolabial folds
     - occurs in up to 50% 
     - bullous lupus, toxic epidermal necrolysis variant of SLP, maculopapular lupus rash, photosensitive lupus rash, or subacute cutaneous lupus (non-indurated psoriasiform and/or annular polycyclic lesions that resolve w/o scarring)
   2. chronic cutaneous lupus: discoid rash, erythematous raised patches w/ adherent keratotic scales and follicular plugging +/- atrophic scarring
      - 3-stage rash affecting ears, cheeks, scalp, forehead, and chest: erythema -> pigmented hyperkeratotic oedematous papules -> atrophic depressed lesions
    3. non scarring alopecia (in absence of other causes)
    4. oral/nasal ulcers (in absence of other causes)
    5. synovitis (involving 2+ joints or 2+ tender joints w/ >30mins of morning stiffness)
    6. serositis: a) lung (pleurisy for >1 day or pleural effusions, or pleural rub) b) pericardial pain for >1 day or pericardial effusion or pericardial rub or pericarditis on ECG
    7. urinalysis: presence of proteinuria (>0.5g/d)or red cell casts
    8. neurological features: seizures, psychosis, mononeuritis multiplex, myelitis, peripheral or cranial neuropathy, cerebritis/acute confusional state in absence of other causes
    9. haemolytic anaemia
    10. leucopenia (WCC <4): at least once, or lymphopenia (lymphocytes <1) at least once
    11. thrombocytopenia (plts <100): at least once
- laboratory criteria
    1. +ve ANA (+ve in >95%)
    2. anti-dsDNA
    3. anti-Sm
    4. antiphospholipid
    5. low complement (C3, C4)
    6. +ve direct Coombs test    

monitoring activity, 3 best tests
1. anti-dsDNA antibody titres
2. complement: dec C3 & C4 (denotes consumption of complement, hence dec C3 & C4 and inc C3D and C4D, their degradation products)
3. ESR; Also: BP, urine for casts for protein (lupus nephritis), FBC, U+E, LFTs, CRP (usually normal); think of SLE whenever someone has a multisystem disorder and inc ESR but CRP normal; if inc CRP think of infection, serositis, or arthritis; skin or renal biopsies may be diagnostic

## Management
refer: complex cases should involve specialist SLE/nephritis clinics
- general measures
  - high-factor sunblock
  - hydroxychloroquine unless contraindicated reduces disease activity and improves survival
  - screen for comorbidities and medication toxicity
  - for skin flares, first trial topical steroids
- maintenance
  - NSAIDs (unless renal disease) and hydroxychloroquine for joint and skin symptoms
  - azathioprine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate as steroid-sparing agents
  - belimumab (monoclonal antibody inhibitor of B-cell activating factor) used as add-on therapy for autoantibody-positive active disease; associated w/ serious psychiatric events, assess psychiatric risk before starting
  - mild flares (no serious organ damage): hydroxychloroquine or low-dose steroids
  - moderate flares (organ involvement): may require DMARDs or mycophenolate
  - severe flares (life- or organ-threatening eg haemolytic anaemia, nephritis, severe pericarditis or CNS disease): urgent high-dose steroids, mycophenolate, rituximab, cyclophosphamide; MDT vital for neuropsychiatric lupus (LP may be indicated)

lupus nephritis
- more intensive immunosuppression w/ steroids and cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate
- rituximab now commonly used and its use w/ little or no additional steroid treatment is being evaluated 
- BP control vital (eg ACE-i)
- RRT may be needed if disease progresses
- nephritis recurs in ~50% post-transplant, but rare cause of graft failure

prognosis: ~80% survival at 15yrs; increased long-term risk of CVD and osteoporosis
