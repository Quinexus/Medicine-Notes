# Rheumatoid Arthritis
Chronic systemic inflammatory disease. Symmetrical, deforming, peripheral polyarthritis

## Background
- epidemiology: ~1% (inc in smokers), M:F=>2:1, 5-6th decade
- associations: DR4/DR1 (assoc w/ inc severity)

## Presentation
- typical: symmetrical swollen, painful, & stiff small joints of hands & feet; worse in morning; can fluctuate and involve larger joints
- less common:
    - sudden-onset, widespread arthritis
    - recurring mono/polyarthritis of various joints (palindromic RA)
    - persistent monoarthritis (knee, shoulder, or hip)
    - systemic illness w/ extra-articular symptoms & pleurisy, but initial few joint problems (commoner in M)
    - recurrent soft tissue problems (e.g. frozen shoulder, carpal tunnel, de Quervain's)
- signs
    - early (inflammation, no joint damage): swollen MCP, PIP, wrist, or MTP joints (often symmetrical); lf tenosynovitis/bursitis
    - later (joint damage, deformity): 
        - ulnar deviation & subluxation of wrist & fingers
        - boutonniere and swan-neck deformities fingers or z-deformity of thumb
        - hand extensor tendons may rupture
        - similar foot changes
        - can involve larger joints
        - atlanto-axial joint subluxation may threaten spinal cord (rare)
- extra-articular manifestations (~40% pts)
    - nodules: elbows, lungs, cardiac, CNS, lymphadenopathy, vasculitis
    - lungs: pleural disease, interstitial fibrosis, bronchiolitis obliterans, organising pneumonia
    - cardiac: IHD, pericarditis, pericardial effusion
    - neuromuscular: carpal tunnel; periphreal neuropathy
    - felty's syndrome (~1%): splenomegaly (seen in 5%) + neutropenia
    - eye: episcleritis, scleritis, scleromalacia, keratoconjunctivitis sicca
    - osteoporosis
    - amyloidosis is rare

## Diagnosis
- rHF: +ve ~70%; high titres -> severe disease, erosions, & extra-articular disease
- anti-CCP: specific (~98%) and reasonable sensitivt (70-80%); may also predict disease progression
- other bloods: anaemia of chronic disease, inc plts, inc ESR, inc CRP
- XR: soft-tissue swelling, juxta-articular osteopenia, and dec joint space; later: bony erosions, subluxation, or complete carpal destruction
- high-res US & MRI: identify synovitis more accurately, greater sensitivity in seeing bone erosions

- diagnostic criteria: ?RA if >= 1 swollen joint and suggestive clinical history not explained by other disease; score >= 6 are diagnostic
    - A joint involvement (swelling/tenderness +/- imaging): 1 large joint=0; 2-10 large joints=1; 1-3 small joints=2; 4-10 small joints=3; >10 joints (at least 1 small joint)=5
    - B serology (at least 1 test result needed): negative=0, lowRForlowCCP=2; highRF/highCCP=3
    - C acute phase reactants (at least 1 test result needed): normalCRP/ESR=0; abnormalCRP/ESR=1
    - D duration of symptoms: <6wks=0; >=6wks=1

## Management
- early rheum referal
    - disease activity using DAS28 & escalate treatment until satisfactory control achieved
    - early DMARDs and biologics improve long-term outcomes
    - steroids rapid reduce symptoms and inflammation; avoid starting unless appropriately experienced; useful for acute exacerbations
        - intra-articular: rapid but short-term
        - oral: difficult symptoms but wary long-term use
    - NSAIDs: symptom relief, no effect on disease; paracetamol/weak opiates rarely effective
    - specialised PT/OT
    - surgery: pain, function, deformity
    - inc risk CVD and cerebrovascular disease <- accelerated atherosclerosis
        - manage RF, stop smoking (also increases Sx)
