# Hyperaldosteronism
primary
    - excess production of aldosterone, indepent of RAAS
    - inc Na and water retention, and dec renin release
    - consider if HTN, hypokalaemia, or alkalosis in someone not on diuretics
secondary
    - due to high renin from dec renal perfusion eg renal artery stenosis, accelerated HTN, diuretics, CCF or hepatic failure

Bartter's syndrome
- major cause of congenital (autosomal recessive) salt wasting - via Na and Cl leak in loop of Henle via mutations in channels and transporters
- presents in childhood w/ failure to thrive, polyuria, and polydipsia
- BP is normal
- Na loss -> volume depletion -> inc renin and aldosterone production -> hypokalaemia and metabolic alkalosis, inc urinary K+ and Cl-
- treatment: K+ replacement, NSAIDs (to inhibit prostaglandins), and ACE-i

## Background
commonest cause of secondary HTN

causes
- ~1/3 due to solitary aldosterone-producing adenoma (some are linked to mutations in K+ channels) = Conn's syndrome
- ~2/3 due to b/l adrenocortical hyperplasia
- rare causes: adrenal carcinoma, or glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (GRA) - the ACTH regulatory element of 11b-hydroxylase gene fuses to the aldosterone synthase gene, inc aldosterone production, & bringing it under control of ACTH

## Presentation
- often asymptomatic or signs of hypokalaemia: weakness (even quadriceps), cramps, paraesthesia, polyuria, polydipsia
- inc BP but not always

## Diagnosis
- initial screening w/ U+E, renin:aldosterone ratio
- if +ve, consider confirmatory saline infusion test, imaging of adrenals and adrenal vein sampling
- do not rely on low K+ as >20% are normokalaemic
- for GRA (? if FH of early HTN), genetic testing is available

## Management
- Conn's
    - laparascopic adrenalectomy
    - medical therapy: MRA (spiro or amiloride) for b/l hyperplasia or those unfit for surgery or prefer medical
- GRA
    - dexamethasone normalise biochemistry but not always BP
    - if elevated BP use spiro as alternative
- adrenal carcinoma: surgery +/- post-operative adrenolytic therapy w/ mitotane - prognosis is poor
