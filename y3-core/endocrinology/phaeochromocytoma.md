# Phaeochromocytoma
rare catecholamine-producing tumours
dangerous but treatable cause of HTN

## Background
- arise from paraganglia cells (= phaeochrome bodies), collections of chromaffin cells, found w/in adrenal medulla
- extra-adrenal (paragangliomas) rarer, found by aortic bifurcation (organs of Zuckerkanld)

- 10% rule:
  - 10% malignant
  - 10% extra-adrenal
  - 10% bilateral
- 30% genetic mutations

associations
- ~70% sporadic
- 30% part of herditary cancer syndrome eg MEN-2A and 2B, neurofibromatosis, VHL syndrome
- mutations in succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)

## Presentation
- classic triad
  - episodic headache
  - sweating
  - tachycardia (+/- inc, dec, or normal BP)

features: ?if BP hard to control, accelerating or episodic
- heart: inc pulse, palpitations/VT, dyspnoea, faints, angina, MI/LVF, cardiomyopathy
- CNS: headache, visual disorder, dizziness, tremor, numbness, fits, encephalopathy, horner's syndrome (paraganglioma), subarachnoid/CNS haemorrhage
- psychological: anxiety, panic, hyperactivity, confusion, episodic psychosis
- gut: D&V, abdo pain over tumour site, mass, mesenteric vasoconstriction
- others: sweats/flushes, heat intolerance, pallor, inc Temp, backache, haemopytsis

- symptoms precipitated by straining, exercise, stress, abdo pressure, surgery of by agents such as beta-blockers, IV contrast agents, metoclopramide, or tricyclics
- site of tumour may determine precipitants
- adrenergic crises may last minutes to days
- suddenly pts feel 'as if about to die' - and then get better or go on to develop stroke or cardiogenic shock
- on exam, may be no signs, or HTN +/- signs of HF/cardiomyopathy (+/- paradoxical shock, similar to Takotsubo's), episodic thyroid swelling, glycosuria during attacks, or terminal haematuria from bladder phaeochromocytoma

## Diagnosis
- biochemical: plasma free metanephrines first line; 24h urine for metanephrines/metadrenaline is an alternative if unavailable
- localisation: abdominal CT/MRI, or meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG, chromaffin-seeking isotope) scan (can find extra-adrenal tumours)

## Management
- surgery: beta-blockade pre-op: phenoxybenzamine or doxazosin is used before beta-blocker to avoid crisis from unopposed beta-adrenergic stimulation, beta-block too if heart disease or tachy. Consult anaesthestist
- post-op: do 24h urine metanephrine 2wks post-op, monitor BP
- !! emergency Rx: if malignant, chemotherapy, or therapeutic radiolabelled MIBG may be used
- follow up: lifelong: malignant recurrence may present late, genetic screening
