# Acromegaly
inc secretion of GH from pituitary tumour (99%) or very rarely hyperplasia (eg ectopic GH-releasing hormone from carcinoid tumour)

## Background
- M:F = 1:1
- incidence: UK 3/mil/yr
- ~5% assoc MEN-1
- GH -> bone and soft-tissue growth through inc secretion of IGF-1

## Presentation
- acroparaesthesia
- amenorrhoea, dec libido
- headache
- inc sweating
- snoring
- arthralgia, backage
- ring, shoe don't fit, wonky bite (malocclusion), curly hair
- weight gain

signs: 
- inc growth of hands, jaw, feet
- coarsening face; wide nose
- big supraorbital ridges
- macroglossia (big tongue)
- widely spaced teeth
- puffy lips, eyelids, and skin (oily and large-pored); also skin tags
- scalp folds (cutis verticis gyrata)
- skin darkening
- acanthosis nigricans
- laryngeal dyspnoea
- OSA
- goitre (inc thyroid vascularity)
- proximal weakness + arthropathy
- signs from any pituitary mass: hypopituitarism +/- local mass effect; fits

signs often predate diagnosis by >4yrs
if acromegaly occurs before epiphyses fuse (rare) -> gigantism

complications (may present w/ CCF or ketoacidosis)
- impaired glucose tolerance (~40%), DM (~15%)
- vascular: inc BP, LVH (+/- dilatation/CCF), cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia; inc risk of IHD and stroke (? inc BP +/- insulin resistance and GH-induced increase in fibrinogen and decrease in protein s)
- neoplasia: inc colon cancer risk; colonoscopy may be needed

pregnancy
- subfertility common
- may be normal pregnancy
- signs and chemistry may remit
- monitor glucose

## Diagnosis
- inc IGF-1 preferred screening test
- GH (not random as pulsatile + inc in stress, sleep, puberty and pregnancy): inhibited by high glucose normally, acromegaly fails to supress

- if inc IGF-1, OGTT needed
    - lowest GH during OGTT >1mcg/L, acromegaly confirmed
    - sensitive assays cutoff 0.3mcg/L
    - collect samples for GH glucose at: 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 min
    - possible false +ves: puberty, pregnancy, hepatic and renal disease, anorexia nervosa, and DM
- MRI pituitary fossa
- signs of hypopituitarism
- visual fields and acuity
- ECG, echo
- old photos
- HbA1c

## Management
correct/prevent tumour compression by excising lesion; aim GH <1mcg/L and normal IGF-1

1. transphenoidal surgery 1st line
2. if surgery fails -> somatostatin analogues (SSAS) +/- radiotherapy (SSAS > RT)
    - SE: pain at injection site; GI abdo cramps, flatulence, loose stools, inc gallstones, impaired glucose tolerance
3. GH antagonist pegvisomant (recombinant GH analogue) used if resistant or intolerant to SSA - suppressess IGF-1 to normal in 90% but GH levels may rise; rarely tumour size increases so monitor closely

RT: if unsuited to surgery, may take years to work

follow-up: yearly GH, IGF-1 +/- OGTT, CV risk reduction, intermittent colonoscopy, photos

prognosis: may return to normal (any excess mortality is mostly vascular); 16% get diabetes w/ SSAS vs ~13% post-surgery
