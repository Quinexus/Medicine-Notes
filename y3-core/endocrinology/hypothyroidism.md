# Hypothyroidism

## Background
- common: 4/1000/yr
- prognosis excellent if treated
- insidious onset, subtle non-specific
- women >=40yrs, F:M=6:1

causes
- primary atrophic hypothyroidism (F:M=6:1): common; diffuse lymphocytic infiltration of thyroid -> atrophy (no goitre)
- hashimoto's:
  - goitre due lymphocytic and plasma cell infiltration
  - commoner women aged 60-70
  - may be hypo or euthyroid, rarely initial period of hyper ('Hashitoxicosis')
  - antibody titres very high
- worldwide: iodine deficiency
- post-thyroidectomy or radioiodine treatment
- drug-induced: anti-thyroid drugs, amiodarone, lithium, iodine, immunotherapy
- subacute thyroiditis: temporary hypothyroidism after hyperthyroid phase
- secondary hypothyroidism: not enough TSH (due to hypopit), v. rare

assocations w/ autoimmune diseases
- turner's and down's
- CF, PBC, OHSS
- POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-protein band (plasmacytoma), + skin pigmentation/tethering)
- genetic dyshormonogenesis: defect in hormone synthesis eg Pendred's syndrome (w/ deafness)

pregnancy: poorly treated -> assoc w/ pre-eclampsia, preterm delivery, low birth weight, pp haemorrhage, cognitive impairment in child; often needs inc levothyroxine dose

myxoedema coma

## Presentation
symptoms
- tiredness
- sleepy, lethargic
- dec mood
- cold-disliking
- inc weight
- constipation
- menorrhagia
- hoarse voice
- dec memory/cognition
- dementia
- myalgia
- cramps
- weakness

signs B RADYCARDIC
- Reflexes relax slowly
- Ataxia (cerebellar)
- Dry thin hair/skin
- Yawning/drowsy/coma
- Cold hands +/- dec To
- Ascites +/- non-pitting oedema (lids, hands, feet) +/- pericardial or pleural effusion
- Round puffy face/double chin/obese
- Defeated demeanour
- Immobile +/- ileus
- CCF
- also: neuropathy, myopathy, goitre

## Diagnosis
- low threshold for TFTs: inc TSH, dec T4 (in rare 2nd-ary hypothyroid: dec T4 and dec or normal TSH due to lack from pit)
- cholesterol and triglycerides inc
- macrocytosis (less often normochromic anaemia)

##Â Management
- healthy and young
  - start levothyroxine, review at 12wks
  - aim for TSH in lower half of reference range
  - consider measuring TSH 3mnthly and titrating levothyroxine as needed - until TSH on target - thereafter monitor TSH yrly
  - enzym inducers inc metabolism of levothyroxine
- elderly or ischaemic heart disease: start w/ lower fixed dose and increase according to TSH (cautiously as levo may precipitate angina or MI)
- ?diagnosis and T4 given: stop T4, recheck TSH in 6wks

amiodarone
- iodine-rich drug, structurally like T4
- 2% -> significant thyroid problems
- hypo caused by toxicity from iodine excess (T4 release inhibited)
- thyrotoxicosis caused by destructive thyroiditis or inc TH synthesis from excess iodine content of amiodarone
- radioiodine uptake scans on gland vascularity on thyroid US may help distinguish cause and strategy of treamtent
- seek expert help
- pts often treated combination of antithyroids and steroids while cause id'd
- thyroidectomy if resistant
