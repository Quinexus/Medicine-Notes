# Addison's disease
primary adrenocortical insufficiency vs secondary adrenal insufficiency


## Background
causes
- primary: rare (~0.8/10000)
    - 80% autoimmunity in UK
    - TB commonest worldwide
    - adrenal mets, lymphoma
    - opportunistic infections HIV
    - adrenal haemorrhage (Waterhouse-Friderichsen; antiphospholipid; SLE)
    - congenital (late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia)
- secondary: 
    - commonest cause iatrogenic = long-term steroid therapy -> suppression of axis; clearer on withdrawal
    - rarer causes: hypothalamic-pituitary disease -> dec ACTH production; mineralocorticoid remains intact & no hyperpigmentation as dec ACTH

physiology
- hypothalamus -> CRF -> pituitary
- pituitary -> ACTH -> adrenal -> cortisol
- cortisol, negative feedback on hypothalamus and pituitary

## Presentation
- late diagnosis
- lean, tanned, tired, tearful +/- weakness, anorexia, dizzy, faints, flu-like, myalgia/arthralgia
- mood: depression, psychosis
- GI: N&V, abdo pain, diarrhoea/constipation 
- pigmented palmar crease & buccal mucosa = inc ACTH cross-reacts w/ melanin receptrs
- postural hypotension
- vitilgo

signs of critical deterioratoin: shock (dec BP, inc HR), inc Temp, coma


## Diagnosis
- bloods: dec Na and inc K (due to dec mineralocorticoid), dec glucose (due to dec cortisol)pp
- other bloods: uraemia, inc Ca2+, eosinophilia, anaemia

- diagnositic test: short ACTH stimulation test (synacthen)
    - plasma cortisol before and 1/2h after tetracosactide (Synacthen) 250mcg IM/IV
    - addison excluded if 30 min cortisol >~550 (threshold may vary)
    - steroids may interefere w/ assays, ask lab
    - in pregnancy & contraceptive pill - cortisol may be reassuring but falsely inc, due to inc cortisol-binding globulin

- ACTH: in Addison's, 9am ACTH is inc (>300: inappropriately high); low in secondary causes
- 21-hydroxylase adrenal auto-antibodies: +ve in autoimmune disease in >80%
- plasma renin & aldosterone: to assess mineralocorticoid status

- adrenal CT/MRI: consider if autoantibodies negative e.g. look TB or mets

## Management
- replace steroids: ~15-25mg hydrocortisone daily in 2-3 doses (e.g. 10mg waking, 5mg lunch, 5mg late afternoon); avoid giving late (may cause insomnia)
- mineralocorticoids: correct postural hypotension, dec Na, inc K
- adjust both based on clinical
- if poor response ?assoc autoimmune disease

- steroid use: 
    - advice wearing bracelet
    - add 5-10mg hydrocortisone to daily intake before strenuous activity/exercis
    - double steroids in febrile illness, injury or stress
    - give out syringes & in-date IM hydrocortisone (and show how to inject 100mg IM if vomiting prevents oral intake)
    - seek medical help; admit for IV fluids if dehydrated

exogenous steroid use 
- replacement steroids vital in those taking long term steroids when acutely unwell -> adrenal insufficiency may develop w/ hypovolaemic shock 
- warn against stopping steroids abruptly
- emphasise prescribing specialists must know steroid use: give steroid card

follow up: yearly (BP, U+E); watch for autoimmune (pernicious anaemia)

prognosis: adrenal crisis and infections -> excess deaths: mean age of death = M:~65 (11 <estimated life expectancy; women lose ~3yrs)
