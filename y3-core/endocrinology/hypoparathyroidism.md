# Hypoparathyroidism

## Background
primary
- dec PTH due to gland failure
- causes: autoimmune, congenital (Di George syn)

secondary
- radiation
- surgery (thyroidectomy, parathyroidectomy)
- hypomagnesaemia (Mg2+ required for PTH secretion)

pseudohypoparathyroidism
- failure of target cell response to PTH

## Presentation
- hypocalcaemia signs
- +/- autoimmune comorbidities

pseudohypoparathyroidism
- short metacarpals (esp 4th and 5th)
- round face
- short stature
- calcified basal ganglia
- dec IQ

## Diagnosis
- dec Ca2+ 
- usually w/ dec or inappropriately normal PTH
- inc PO43- or normal
- normal ALP

pseudohypoparathyroidism: dec Ca2+, inc PTH, normal or inc ALP

##Â Management
- activated vitamin D (calcitriol/alfacalcidol) combined w/ Ca2+ supplements
- aim for low-normal Ca2+
- daily recombinant synthetic PTH injections are available - emergent treatment option

pseudohypoparathyroidism: same as primary hypoparathyroidism
