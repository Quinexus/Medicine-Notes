# Acute adrenal insufficiency

## Background
- Undiagnosed adrenal insufficiency (e.g autoimmune, non-classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia, b/l adrenal haemorrhage (meningococcal sepsis)
    - consider if current/previous exogenous glucocorticoids w/in last year (oral, intra-articular, IM, inhaled, nasal, topical)
- known adrenal insufficiency: existing cortisol replacement does not meet and increased need (e.g. illness, vomiting/diarrhoea, pregnancy, surgery, non-adherence)

- precipitating factors: infection, trauma, surgery, missed medication

## Presentation
Hypoglycamia, inc HR, postural hypotension/dec BP, vomiting, weakness, shock, confusion, coma

## Diagnosis
- if ? treat before results
    - bloods: paired cortisol & ACTH (direct to lab on ice, call ahead), glucose, U+Es
    - monitor blood glucose: risk of hypo
    - look for infectious trigger: blood, urine, & sputum cultures, CXR

## Management
- inital fluid resus
- hydrocortisone 100mg IV -> 200mg hydrocortisone/24h continous IVI in 5% glucose or hydrocortisone 50mg IM/6h (100mg if BMI > 40)
- ongoing rehydration +/- IV glucose (if hypo)
- inc K+: ECG, cardiac monitor & treatment
- treat underlying infection
- expert endocrine input for diagnosis, conversion/tapering of oral steroids, indications for fludrocortisone, and 'sick day rules' education before hospital discharge
