# Venous Ulcers

## Background
- typical causes of ulcers
  - neuropathy
  - vascular: venous 75%, arterial 10%, mixed 15%
  - trauma
- rarer causes
  - pyoderma gangrenosum
  - sickle cell
  - vasculitis
  - cryoglobulinaemia
  - malignancy
  - infection
  - drugs

risk factors
- varicose veins
- DVT
- venous insufficiency
- poor calf muscle function
- arteriovenous fistulae
- obesity
- leg fracture
- venous HTN from damaged valves of deep venous system -> superficial varicosities & skin changes
- minimal trauma over medial malleolus

## Presentation
- pain
- varicose eczema
- hyperpigmentation
- lipodermatosclerosis (inflammation of layer of fat under dermis and ill-defined band)

## Diagnosis
- clinical
- doppler to exclude arterial diseas (ABP > 0.8)

## Management
- graded compression bandaging, pressure reduces from ankle (40mmHg) to calf (15-20mmHg) -> reduces superificial venous pressure
- heal better w/ occlusive dressing which absorb exudate and improve comfort
- infection treated w/ systemic antibiotics until definitive sensitivities available (swab only if ?infection)
- avoid topical antibiotics as inc risk of resistance and contact dermatitis
- ensure adequate analgesia
- involve tissue viability nurses
- Pentoxifylline 400mg TDS PO for upto 6 months can be considered to promote healing (unlicenced and not common)
- non-healing on 3 months of adequate treatment -> further investigation
- once healed -> prevention
  - compression stockings
  - skin care
  - leg elevation
  - calf-exercises
  - good nutrition
