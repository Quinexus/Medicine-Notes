#Â Rosacea
chronic relapsing/remitting disorder of blood vessels and pilosebaceous units in central facial areas typically in fair-skinned people

## Background
prevalance: 10%
cause: unknown; demodex mites are sometimes observed in papules but their role is unclear

## Presentation
- pre-rosacea features
  - flushing triggered by stress/blushing
  - alcohol
  - spices
- signs
  - central facial rash (usually symmetrical) w/ erythema
  - telangectasia
  - papules & pustules (w/o comedomes)
  - inflammatory nodules +/- facial lymphoedema
  - blepharitis/conjunctivitis (ocular rosacea)
  - med: rhinophyma (swelling + soft tissue overgrowth of nose) may occur

## Diagnosis

## Management

- use soap substitutes
- avoid sun exposure
- use sun-block

- mild disease
  - topical metronidazole gel or cream x2/day for 3-4mnths or topical 15% azelaic acid gel (may cause transient stinging)
  - topical ivermectin can be used for papulopustular rosacea
  - both anti-inflammatory and controls Demodex mites
- moderate/severe disease
  - oral tetracycline (or erythromycin if contraindicated) taken for 4mnths helps control extensive papules or pustules but has little effect on redness
  - low-dose doxycycline is also licensed and effective
  - oral isotretinoin and lasers are rarely needed
- ocular rosacea: eyelid hygiene, ocular lubricants +/- ciclosporin 0.5% (specialist use)
