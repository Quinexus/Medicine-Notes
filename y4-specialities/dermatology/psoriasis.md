# Psoriasis
chronic inflammatory skin condition characterised by scaly erythematous plaques, typically follows relapsing/remitting course

## Background
pathophysioloy
- epidermis in psoriasis plaques is hyperproliferative
- proliferation and dilatation of blood vessels in dermis + infiltration of inflammatory cells (T-cells +/- neutrophils)
- plaque psoriasis commonest form (~90%)

prevalence
- 1-3% (varying among ethnic groups eg 0.3% in China)
- 75% are affected before 46yrs old (uncommon in children)
- M:F~1:1
- susceptibility is inherited - if both parents have psoriasis, risk to offspring is ~50%

aetiology
- stress
- infections: esp. streps
- skin trauma: Kobner
- drugs: lithium, NSAIDs, beta-blockers, antimalarials
- lifestyle: alcohol, obesity, smoking and climate
- psychological & social: 20% depressed; consider impact on body image, mood, relationships, work/school, and any problems caused by treatment


## Presentation
types of psoriasis
- chronic plaque psoriasis: symmetrical, well-defined red plaques w/ silvery scale on extensor aspects of elbows, knees, scalp, and sacrum
- flexural psoriasis: plaques in moist flexural areas (axillae, groins, submammary areas, and umbilicus) are less scaly and often misdiagnosed as fungal infection (symmetry suggests psoriasis)
- pustular psoriasis (palmoplantar psoriasis): yellow-brown pustules w/in plaques affecting palms & soles; M:F~9:1
- generalised (erythrodermic) psoriasis (and generalised pustular psoriasis): may cause severe systemic upset (fever, inc WCC, dehydration) - both are a medical emergency requiring urgent hospital referral; NB: also triggered by rapid withdrawal of steroids
- nail changes (in 50%): pitting, onycholysis (separation from nail-bed), thickening, and subungual hyperkeratosis

psoriatic arthropathy: 7% develop seronegative arthropathy, screen annually using PEST questionnaire; 5 types:
1. Asymmetrical mono/oligoarthitis
2. Symmetrical polyarthritis (RA-like)
3. Psoriatic spondylitis
4. Distal predominant
5. Arthritis mutilans (destructive)
joint disease can precede skin disease

## Diagnosis
- DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index) scoring for psychological/social

differentials: eczema; tinea (solitary or few lesions; asymmetrical; expanding); mycosis fungoides (asymmetric, less scaling, do biopsy); seborrhoeic dermatitis

## Management
- education is vital; control, not cure is realistic
- assess severity & proportion of skin affected (Psoriasis Area Severity Index)
- consider phototherapy or systemic therapy if >10% body area affected
- emollients reduce scale and help relieve irritation
- for all topicals select a base the pt prefers (ointment, cream, lotion, gel, or foam)

topical
- plaque psoriasis
    - use topical corticosteroid (eg Betnovate) each morning plus a topical vitamin D preparation (which affects cell division; eg Dovonex) at night. 
    - NB: Dovobet is a combined once-daily ointment or gel. Enstilar if combined foam formulation and some pts prefer this.
    - review at 4wks (advise pt to stop steroid before if skin is clear); if response is good, continue until skin is clear or nearly clear
    - potent corticosteroids should not be used for more than 8 wks + there should be a treatment break of 4wks before being restarted (during which vitamin D analogues can be continued)
    - 1% coal tar lotion (eg Exorex) if easier if widespread thin-plaque disease (not limited to use on affected skin); monitor FBC, U+E, LFT, glucose, and fasting lipid profile
- scalp psoriasis
    - potent topical steroid lotion (OD for max 8wks) or vitamin D analogue scalp preparation
    - coal tar shampoos may help
    - Diprosalic (combined steroid and salicyclic acid) softens and lifts scale, allowing the steroid to exert its effect underneath
- flexural psoriasis: use a mild-moderate potent topical steroid for up to 2wks (+/- antifungal/antibiotic combination; break for 4wks between courses
- localised pustular psoriasis & nail psoriasis: best managed by a dermatologist
- psoriatic arthropathy: NSAIDs, DMARDS (eg methotrexate), and anti-TNF agents
