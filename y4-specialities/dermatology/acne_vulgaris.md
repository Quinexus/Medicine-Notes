# Acne Vulgaris

## Background

5 pillars of acne
1. basal keratinocytes proliferation in pilosebaceous follicles (androgen- and corticotropin-releasing hormone driven)
2. inc sebum production
3. Propionibacterium acnes colonisation
4. inflammation
5. comedomes (white- & black-heads) blocking secretions, hence papules, nodules, cytes, and scars (face, neck, upper torso)

- almost universal in teenagers
- most acne dont have inc androgens but their sebaceous glands are more sensitive to androgens


## Presentation

mild acne: mainly facial comedomes
moderate acne: inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules) dominate, affecting face +/- torso
severe acne: nodules, cysts, scars, and inflammatory papules and pustules; refer to a specialist

## Diagnosis

##Â Management

teenage acne
- be holistic
- subtly promote mental health
- dispel myths: NOT due to dirt, lack of washing, etc. & not infectious/contagious
- diet has little or no effect
- ask about mood, effect on body image/self-esteem & fears of social rejection
- suicidal ideation red flag

mild acne
- topical benzoyl peroxide (start with low strength) or topical retinoid (avoid in pregnancy)
- if poorly tolerated, try azelaic acid
- treatment takes upto 8 wks to be effective
- if response is poor, consider topical antibiotic combined w/ benzoyl peroxide or topical retinoid

moderate acne
- topical antibiotic combined w/ benzoyl peroxide or topical retinoid (reduces bacterial resistance; for max 12wks)
- oral antibiotic: tetracyclines 1st line (erythromycin if pregnant or <12yrs old); use for >~4-6mnths w/ topical benzoyl peroxide; do not use topicals at same time
- topical retinoid w/ benzoyl peroxide is an alternative that can be used
- females, consider standard COCP if contraception required; or if treatment has failed, a COCP w/ antiandrogen activity (if no cis)

severe acne
- isotretinoin may be best option (dec sebum production & pituitary hormones; specialist prescribing in UK)
- marked benefit occurs in virtually all patients (permanent ~65%)
- SE: teratogenic (contraception must be used during + for 1 month before and after); skin & mucosal dryness; depression
