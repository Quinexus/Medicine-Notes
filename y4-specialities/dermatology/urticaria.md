# Urticaria

## Background
ordinary
- acute precipitated by:
  - infections and parasites (helminths)
  - chemicals (insect bites, latex, drugs, or food)
  - systemic disease
- chronic
  - idiopathic in most
  - ~30% histamine-releasing autoantibodies

physical
- induced reproducibly by external trigger
  - dermographism: wheal on rubbing/stroking skin
  - cold contact: occurs on exposure to cold air/water
  - delayed pressure: sustained pressure causes wheals after a delay of 30min-6h
  - solar urticaria: occurs on UV exposure

urticarial vasculitis
- cutaneous lesions resemble urticaria (tender wheals)
- small-vessel cutaneous vasculitis (palpable purpura)
- if complement levels are low, it may be associated w/ SLE

## Presentation
ordinary
- acute: smooth, erythematous, itchy hives, and wheals are 
- chronic (= >6wks), lasts months-years (continuous or episodic)

##Â Diagnosis
ordinary acute: skin prick or blood RAST tests

## Management
antihistamines: response to different antihistamines varies from pt to pt so several may have to be tried before the one that provides benefit is found

ordinary chronic: non-sedating antihistamines can be up-titrated to 4 times recommended dose if required

urticarial vasculitis: antihistamine, NSAIDs, but some pts may need immunosuppressive therapy
