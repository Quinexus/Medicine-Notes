# Tinnitus
perception of sound, typically in absence of auditory stimulation; often symptom of underlying abnormality

##Â Background
- prevelance - 15% (0.5% severe)
- 2/3 pts have associated SNHL
- 1/3 no identifiable cause

pathophysiology
- poorly understood
- possible mechanisms
  - spontaneous otoacoustic emissions
  - altered or increased spontaneous activity in auditory nerve or central structures
  - plastic reorganisations of central pathways
  - inappropriate feedback via descending pathways
  - auditory-limbic interactions
- able to habituate tinnitus usually, if not becomes problematic

## Presentation
character to ID aetiology
- u/l or b/l
- pulsatile or non-pulsatile
- ringing, hissing, or buzzing suggests inner ear or central cause
- popping or clicking suggests problem in external or middle ear or palate
- pulsatile: often objective but can reflect increased awareness of blood flow in ear

classification: may be objective or subjective
- objective (audible to examiner): rare and occurs due to
  - vascular disorders: pulsatile vibratory sounds from eg AV malformations, carotid pathology, glomus tumours
  - high-output cardiac states: Paget's, hyperthyroidism, anaemia, causing pulsatile tinnitus
  - myoclonus of palatal or stapedius/tensor tympani muscles, resulting in audible click
  - patulous eustachian tube: prolonged opening, causing abnormal sound transmission to ear
- subjective: only audible to pt
  - most commonly assoc w/ disorders causing SNHL eg presbycusis, noise-induced hearing loss, Meniere's (u/l)
  - conductive deafness less commonly associated eg impacted wax, otosclerosis
  - ototoxic drugs: b/l tinnitus + hearing loss
    - cisplatin and aminoglycosides can cause permenant hearing loss
    - aspirin, NSAIDs, quinine, macrolides, and loop diuretics assoc w/ tinnitus and reversible hearing loss
  - otitis media +/- effusion
  - other: hyper/hypothyroidism, diabetes, MS, acoustic neuroma (u/l), trauma to H&N, anxiety & depression (assoc and may exacerbate)

## Diagnosis
- audiometry
- tympanogram
- investigate u/l tinnitus (MRI) to exclude acoustic neuroma (10% present this way)

## Management
- treat underlying cause
- explain tinnitus - common and improves w/ time (via habituation)
- ask about beliefs and address concerns
- manage depression, anxiety or insomnia
- positive attitudes help
- whole person not just malfunctioning ear
- treatment aimed at reducing impact of symptoms

- hearing aids: if hearing loss >35DB, hearing aid that improves perception of background noise makes tinnitus less apparent
- psychological support: psychoeducational counselling together w/ sound therapy (use of background sound to reduce impact of tinnitus by partially masking it eg from radio or fan) are mainstay of rehab
- cognitive behavioural therapy: identify and modify unhelpful thoughts and behaviours
