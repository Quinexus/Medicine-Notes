# Acoustic Neuroma
- indolent, histologically benign tumour
- arises from Schwann cells of superior vesticular nerve (vestibular schwannoma)


## Background
- originates in internal auditory canal -> local pressure on auditory, vestibular, and facial nerves in narrow space of canal
- continued growth -> medial extension into cerebropontine angle -> SOL
- causes: 95% sporadic, 5% NF2

## Presentations
- unilateral hearing loss 70%
- unilateral non-pulsatile tinnitus 50%
- balance problems 20%
- larger tumours -> paraesthesia of face inc loss of corneal reflex, headaches, cerebellar dysfunction, facial nerve palsy, inc ICP signs and other CN palsies

## Diagnosis
pure tone audiogram and speech audiogram
MRI scan

ddx: meningioma 10%, epidermoid tumours 5%, lower nerve schwannomas 2%, arachnoid cysts 1%

## Management
- watchful waiting w/ interval MRI scans in small slow growing tumours
- surgical removal for large or rapidly growing tumours using translabyrinthine, middle fossa, or retrosigmoid approaches
- stereotactic radiosurgery is increasingly popular
