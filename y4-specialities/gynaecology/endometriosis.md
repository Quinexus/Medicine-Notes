#Â Endometriosis
- prescence of endometriotic tissue outside uterus
- hormonally driven (oestrogen), affects women of reproductive age
- adenomyosis = presence of endometrial tissue w/in myometrium
- wide variation in severity of disease and its impact on pain
- some women relatively asympatomatic w/ extensive disease while otehrs only have superficial endometriotic depositis w/ debilitating symptoms

## Background
cause/three main theories
1. retrograde menstruation -> adherence, invasion, and growth of tissue
2. metaplasia of mesothelial cells (explains why it can develop in unusual places such as lung and nasal cavity)
3. impaired immunity -> endometrial cells from retrograde menstruation fail to be destroyed by immune response

10-12% of general female population
20-50% of those undergoing fertility or chronic pain investigation
40-60% of those w/ dysmenorrhoea

## Presentation
- pain
  - cyclical due to endometrial tissue responding to mentrual cycle
  - constant due to formation of adhesions from chronic inflammation
  - severe dysmenorrhoea leading to time off work/school
  - deep dyspareunia from involvement of uterosacral ligaments
  - dysuria
  - dyschezia (pain on defaecation) and/or cyclical rectal bleeding (rectovaginal nodules w/ invasion of rectal mucosa)
- subfertility
- no symptoms

examination
- may be normal if minimal disease
- speculum exam may show visible lesions in vagina or cervix but rare and sign of deep infiltrating endometriosis
- bimanual vaginal exam - fixed retroverted uterus = classical sign
- adnexal masses or tenderness and tender nodules palpable over uterosacral ligaments

## Diagnosis
- TVS useful for diagnosis of ovarian endometriotic cysts but poor at identifying other parameters of disease
- ?bowel involvement -> MRI to map extent
- Ca125 may be raised but not used for screening
- gold standard = laparascopy w/ biopsy for histological confirmation
  - esp important for diagnosis of deep infiltrating lesions should be avoided w/in 3 months of hormonal therapy -> underdiagnosis
  - extent documented w/ photographs

## Treatment
- depends on symptoms and issue pain or subfertility
- acceptable to treat empirically w/ COCP/progesterone w/o laparoscopic diagnosis if fertility not issue
- NSAIDs effective analgesia
- ?severe endometriosis should be managed and treated by a centre w/ expertise in advanced laparoscopic surgery

medical treatment
- COCP (cyclical or continuous)
- progestogens orally, IM, or SC
- mirena IUS (can be inserted at laparoscopy)
- GnRH analogues

surgical
- once medical treatment has failed or fertility is priority
- laparoscopy mainstay -> ablation or excision
- nodules should be excised and endometriomas removed rather than drained (otherwise high recurrance)
- mild-moderate disease, spontaneous pregnancy rates are increased after surgical removal of endometriotic lesions
- severe disease + subfertility: excision may not alter pregnancy outcome and reduce ovarian reserve
- hysterectomy last resort

endometriosis & chronic pelvic pain
- high rates of relapse after stopping treatments such as COCP, and some pts w/ deep/superficial endometriosis and those w/ adenomyosis (endometrotic tissue largely inaccessible by surgery) -> chronic pain
- difficult to treat -> endometriosis specialist in specialist centre
- multiple repeat laparoscopies not answer unless evidence of recurrence
- consider other non-gynae causes which may coexist
- manage w/ analgesia (opiates? but check w/ pain clinic), neuropathic treatments, and hormonal treatments
- ?requesting hysterectomy -> GnRH analogues predicts successful pain relief
- also consider support groups and if depression also present, should be treated
