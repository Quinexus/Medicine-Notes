# Ectopic Pregnancy
fertilised ovum implants outside uterine cavity

## Background
- incidence: 11.1:1000 pregnancy and risign, worldwide rates higher
- ~7% maternal deaths due to ectopics (1.8 deaths/1000 ectopics)

RFs
- anything slowing ovum's passage to uterus increases risk
- damage to tubes (PID, previous surgery)
- previous ectopic
- endometriosis
- IUCD, PoP, subfertility and IVF
- smoking
- pregnancy after tubal ligation 9x likely

site
- 97% tubal
- mostly in ampulla
- 25% in narrow inextensible isthmus (presents early, inc risk of rupture)
- 3% implant on ovary, cervix, c-section scar, or peritoneum

## Presentation
always think ectopic in sexually active women w/ abdominal pain, bleeding, fainting, or D&V
- often no symptoms or signs, uncertain LMP
- amenorrhoea 6-8wks
- pain, may be non-specific lower abdo pain, but classically unilateral
- vaginal bleeding
- diarrhoea, loose stools, and/or vomiting
- dizziness
- shoulder tip pain from diaphragmatic irritation frmo haemoperitoneum
- collapse
- normal-sized uterus
- cervical excitation w/ or w/o adnexal tenderness
- rarely adnexal mass
- peritonism

vaginal & speculum exam do not rupture ectopics

## Diagnosis
- FBC, group and save (if unstable cross match 6 units of blood, insert 2 large-bore IV cannulas, give IV fluids, call senior help), serum progesterone - identify failing pregnancy, and hCG to guide management
- hormones do not distinguish where pregnancy is only transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) can do that and is the primary diagnostic modality
- USS lf adnexal mass which moves separately to ovary if tubal
- further hCG in 48h may help decide management

## Management
if stable women offered options of expectant and medical according to strict selection criteria
- asymptomatic or mild symptoms
- hCG <3000
- ectopic pregnancy <3cm on scan w/ no fetal heart activity
- no haemoperitoneum on TVS
- women must understand the diagnosis and risks of ectopic and must be willing to undertake regular follow-up and live close to hospital w/ support at home

- expectant
  - falling hCG ideally <1500 and criteria
  - take serum hCG 48hrly until confirmed fall then wkly until <15
  - plateuing or slow rising hCG -> senior clincial involvement
- medical
  - methotrexate (unlicensed) single dose
  - followed by hCG levels on days 4 and 7
  - if hCG fallen by <15% repeat dose given (upto 25% cases)
  - need contraception 3mnths post methotrexate (teratogenic)
  - no improvement in pain? -> simple analgesia + hospital immediately
  - hCG not predictive of rupture
- surgical
  - laparascopy preferred: reduced operating time, reduced length of hospital stay, reduced analgesia, and less blood loss w/ quicker recovery
  - do not delay seeking senior help in unstable pt w/ ?ruptured ectopic

salpingOTOMY vs salpingECTOMY
- if contralateral tube healthy -> ECTOMY (remove tube) > OTOMY (tube incision ectopic removal)
- subsequent intrauterine pregnancy rates are no different -ECTOMY
- -OTOMY has higher rates of persistent trophoblast (8vs4%) and subsequent ecptioc (18v8%)
- -OTOMY if other tube unhealthy to preserve chance of future intrauterine pregnancy (49%) but warn risk of future ectopic
- -OTOMY need follow up w/ serum hCG to detect and treat persistent trophoblast early (methotrexate if stable)
