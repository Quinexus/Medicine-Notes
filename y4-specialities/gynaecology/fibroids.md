# Fibroids
uterine leiomyomata = benign smooth muscle tumours of uterus

## Background
- often multiple and vary in size from seedling to tumours
- large part of abdomen
- lumps in wall of uterus
  - bulge out of wall so lie in visceral peritoneum = subserosal 20%
  - intramurally 
  - under the endometrium = submucosal 5%
  - or become pedunculated
- common = 20-40% women of reproductive age have fibroids increasting in frequency w/ age in Afro-Caribbean women and those w/ FH fibroids

associations: gene mutation fumarate hydratase can cause fibroids, rare association w/ skin & uterine leiomyomata and RCC

natural history
- oestrogen dependent
- enlarge in pregnancy & COCP, and atrophy in menopause
- degenerate gradually or suddenly (red degeneration)
- ocassionally calcify ('womb stones')
- rarely undergo sarcomatous change -> pain, malaise, bleeding and increase in size in postmenopausal woman

in pregnancy
- commoner in afro-caribbean women
- increase in pregnancy esp 2nd trimester
- US aids diagnosis, doppler fibroids from myometrium
- if pedunculated -> may tort
- red degeneration: thrombosis of capsular vessels -> venous engorgement and inflammation - usually last half of pregnancy or puerperium
- treatment expectant w/ resolution over 4-7 days
- many in body of uterus and do not obstruct labour, rise away from pelvis throughout pregnancy
- if large noted, c-section may be required

## Presentation
- many asymptomatic
- menorrhagia: heavy & prolonged periods (+/- anaemia), do not cause intermenstrual/postmenopausal bleeding
- fertility problems: submucosal fibroids may interfere w/ implantation, large/multiple tumours -> distort uterine cavity -> mistcarriage (unproven)
- pain: torsion of pedunculated ~ torted ovarian cyst; 'red degeneration' following thrombosis of fibroid blood supply
- mass: large may felt abdominally; press on bladder -> frequency; on veins -> oedema legs and varicose veins; may obstruct labour or cause urine retention

## Diagnosis

## Management
minimal symptoms = no treatment

- GnRH analogues: for 3-6mnts prior to surgery to shrink fibroids; not long-term due to demineralisation of bone
- Ulipristal acetate
  - selective progesterone receptor modulator for 3 months to shrink fibroids and induce amenorrhoea
  - should not be used pending further safety investigations due to risk of serious liver injury
- myomectomy
  - hysteroscopic, laparoscopic, or open depending on size and location
  - submucosal better hysteroscopically and laparoscopic myomectomy demands advanced minimal access skills as well as an isolated subserous fibroid
  - open myomectomy 10% risk of hysterectomy due to bleeding and less straightforward
  - if endometrial cavity breached at laparascopic/open myomectomy -> future pregnancy elective CS, prevent uterine rupture in labour
- uterine artery embolisation
  - undertaken by interventional radiologist after assessment by MRI
  - uterine artery catheterised and embolised
  - avoid general anaesthetic but extremely painful in recovery period
  - may lead to necrotic, infected uterus
  - pregnancy outcomes better after myomecotmy thn UAE and UAE not recommended by fertility specialists for women wishing to retain fertility
  - hysterectomy reserved for women who have completed family or have no wish preserving fertility
