# Subfertility

## Background
- 84% of couples having regular intercourse concieve w/in a year (92% by 2 years)
- secondary care referral after 1yr of trying
    - earlier if F aged >=36 yrs
    - amenorrhoea
    - oligomenorrhoea
    - or past PID
    - undescended testes
    - cancer treatments which may affect fertility
- fertility decreases w/ age

causes
- anovulation: 21%
  - premature ovarian failure
  - turner syndrome
  - surgery
  - chemotherapy
  - PCOS
  - excessive weight loss/exercise
  - hypopituitarism
  - kallman syndrome
  - hyperprolactinaemia
- male factor: 25%
- tubal factor: 15-20%
- unexplained: 28%
- endometriosis: 6-8%

## Presentation
history
- takes 2 to be infertile (F causes ~67%), see both parents
- note age and duration of subfertility
- previous previous? either partner have children?
- mentrual Hx, regularity, pelvic pain, history of STIs, previous surgery (tubal or for ectopic pregnancy)
- smoking and drinking more than recomended decreases fertility in both partners
- medical and drug history and optimise
- ask freq of sex and any problems during sex inc erectile dysfunction
- ask man about Hx of undescended testes, mumps as adult, and check medical, drug history, and smoking and alcohol use

examination
- BMI (obesity effects fertility, cannot start treatment in high BMI)
- endocrine disorder signs?
- exclude pelvic pathology
- surgical treatment of scrotal varicocele has not effect on pregnancy

## Diagnosis
primary care
- chlamydia screening
- baseline hormonal profile (day 2-5 FSH and LH)
- TSH, prolactin, and testosterone and rubella (vaccinate if non-immune)
- mid-luteal progesterone level to confirm ovulation (7 days before expected period; eg 21 day if 28-day cycle, >30 indicative of ovulation)
- semen analysis; repeat in 3 months if abnormal after making lifestyle changes and starting a multivitamin containing selenium, zinc, and vitamin c
  - volume
  - concentration
  - progressive motility
  - total motility
  - normal forms

secondary care
- TVS to rule out adenexal masses, submucosal fibroids or endometrial polpys, or help confirm PCOS
- hysterosalpingogram (HSG) uses XR and contrast injected through small cannula in cervix to demonstrate uterine anatomy and tubal patency
  - may cause period-like cramps and tubal spasm giving false positive
  - only perform once chlamydia swabs negative and give azithromycin 
  - hysterosalpingo-contrast sonograph (HYCOSY) similar to above, but using US contrast and TVS
  - laparscopy and dye test - day case procedure and gold standard for assessing tubal patency
    - methylene blue dye injected through cervix while tubes visualised w/ laparoscope
    - 1st line if strong clinical suspicion of tubal abnormality or needs laparascopy for other reasons
    - 2nd line if HSG or hycosy abnormal
    - pelvic pathology can be treated as same time

##Â Management
lifestyle modifcation
- treatment directed at cause
- couple should lose or gain weight to normal bmi
- eat healthy diet
- stop smoking +/- recreational drugs
- reduce alcohol consumption to less than recommended limits
- take regular exercise
- folic acid (women)
- aim to have regular intercourse every 2-3 days (avoid timed intercourse)
- avoid ovulation monitors (increase stress and no evidence of benefit)
- couples who time intercourse for day of ovulation may be too late - ideally should be some sperm available for fertilisation whenever ovulation occurs

ovulation induction: several methods to induce ovulation; PCOS most common cause of anovulatory subfertility, accounting for 80%
- weight loss or gain
- clomifene citrate: 50mg days 2-6 of cycle
  - anti-oestrogen -> increases endogenous FSH via negative feedback to pituitary
  - 10% multiple pregnancy rate (higher if used inappropriately)
  - can cause hot flushes, labile mood; if severe headache or visual disturbance, stop immediately
  - should only be used for 6-12 cycles (posisble link w/ ovarian cancer)
  - needs follicular monitoring by US (risk of hyperstimulation)
  - should be prescribed by specialist, ideally after tubal patency confirmed and semen count normal or near-normal and BMI <30-35
- laparoscopic ovarian drilling
  - used in pts w/ PCOS only
  - small holes are drilled into each ovary using needlepoint diathermy w/ aim of reducing LH and restoring feedback mechanisms
  - successful in 50% and effects last for 12-18 months
- gonadotrophins: used in specialist fertility units for clomifene-resistant PCOS or low oestrogen w/ normal FSH; injected, expensive, and needs US monitoring
- metformin: controversial and used in women w/ PCOS; possible small increase in ovulation rates but it is not licensed & weight loss is more effective

surgical techniques
- tubal disease: proximal blocks may respond to tubal catherisation or hysteroscopic cannulation; high rates of ectopic pregnancy
- endometriosis
- intrauterine adhesions: use hysterscopic adhesiolysis

in vitro fertilisation
- indications: include
  - tubal disease
  - male factor subfertility
  - endometriosis
  - anovulation not responding to clomifene
  - subfertility due to maternal age
  - unexplained subfertility >2yrs
- success
  - depends on many factors: age, duration of subfertility, previous pregnancy (higher success rate), smoking, and high BMI (lower success)
  - low anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) levels predict poorer response
  - women w/ hydrosalpinges should have salpingectomy prior to IVF to inc chance of live birth
  - screen couple for HIV, hepatitis B&C
  - ovaries are stimulated (OHSS), ova collected (by transvaginal aspiration under transvaginal US guidance), fertilised, and 3-5 days later, 1-2 embryos returned under US guidance to uterus as an outpatient procedure
  - luteal support given in form of progestogens and 2 weeks later woman should do a pregnancy test

NHS-funded assisted conception
- inclusion criteria vary between regions, but generally limited to couples w/
- no children
- non-smokers
- BMI <30
- under 42yrs of age (35 in some counties)
- who do not require gamate donation

egg donation
- can offer women a change of pregnancy when previous IVF attempts have failed, in ovarian failure, and in women >45yrs
- adoption and fostering also options
