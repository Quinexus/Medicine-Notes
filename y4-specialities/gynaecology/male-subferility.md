# Male Subfertility

## Background
- spermatogenesis takes place in seminiferous tubules
- undifferentiated diploid germ cells (spermatogonia) multiply and are transformed into haploid spermatozoa, a process taking 74 days
- FSH and LH are both important for initiation of spermatogenesis at puberty
- LH stimulates leydig cells -> testosterone
- testosterone + FSH stimulates sertoli cells -> essential substances for metabolic support of germ cells and spermatogenesis
- spermatozoa
  - spermatozoon has dense oval head (containing haploid chromosome complement) 
  - capped by an acrosome granule (contains enzymes essential for fertilisation)
  - propelled by motile tail
  - seminal fluid forms 90% of ejaculate volume and is alkaline to buffer vaginal acidity

male factors
- ~25% of subfertile couples
- only small number have identifiable treatable cause

- semen abnormality (85%)
  - idiopathic oligoasthenoteratozoospermia, testicular cancer, drugs such as alcohol and nicotine, varicocele
- azoospermia (5%)  
  - pre-testicular eg anabolic steroid use, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, kallman syndrome
  - non-obstructive: cryptorchidism, orchitis, 47 xxy (klinefelter), chemotherapy
  - obstructive: congenital b/l absence of vas deference (CBAVD), vasectomy, chlamydia, gonorrhoea
- immunological (5%)
  - anti-sperm antibodies, idiopathic, infective
- coital dysfunction (5%)
  - erectile dysfunction w/ normal sperm function (remember drug causes such as beta-blockers, antidepressants)
  - hypospadias, phimosis, disability
  - retrograde ejaculation
  - failure in ejaculation (multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury)

## Presentation
examination
- look at body form and secondary sexual characteristics
- ?gynaecomastial
- normal testicular volume = 15-35mL (compare w/ Prader orchidometer)
- testicular US if exam is abnormal
- rectal exam may reveal prostatitis

## Diagnosis
- plasma FSH raised in testicular failure
- testosterone and LH levels are indicated if ?androgen deficiency
- karyotype to exclude 47 xxy and CF screen (associated w/ CBAVD)

## Management
- address lifestyle issues, such as alcohol and smoking
- optimise underlying medical conditions and consider stopping or changing medication
- consider starting multivitamin containing zinc, selenium, and vitamin C
- repeat semen analysis 3 months after making changes

ICSI = intracytoplasmic sperm injection
- (direct into egg)
- main tool for most male subfertility
- source of sperm is epididymis or testis in men w/ obstructive azoospermia
- even if problem is non-obstructive, sperm can be retrieved in ~50%
