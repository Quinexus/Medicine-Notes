# Depression

## Background
- clinical depression =/= depressive symptoms
- worldwide 5.8% of men and 9.5% expressive depressive episode in 12-month period ~121 mil
- 4th cause of disability worldwide and accounts for 5-10% consultations in primary care in UK

classification: based on number & severity of these features; helps determine management, treatment and prognosis

aetiology
- biological
  - heritability
  - monoamine theory of depression: dec monoamine function may cause depression
  - endocrinology f:m>1:1, dex suppression test abnormal in 1/3
  - structural brain change: ventricular enlargement and raised sucal prominence
- psychological
  - personality traits: neuroticism suggests mood lability, autonomic hyperarousal, and negative biases in attention and processing
  - low self-esteem is considered RF but debatable if cause or symptom
  - childhood experiences may inc sensitivity to events
- social
  - disruption due to life events in 60% of cases
  - stress associated w/ poor social environment and social isolation can precipitate and perpetuate depression; social drift to lower social class

## Presentation
core symptoms
- depressed mood for most the day, every day; little variation in mood despite changes in time, circumstances, or activity; diurnal mood variation (worse in mornings and improving as day proceeds)
- anhedonia: loss of interest/pleasure in daily life esp in things previously enjoyed; this change can be subjective/observed change
- fatigue: lack of energy which goes beyond poor sleep and pervades life

typical symptoms (1st 5 are 'biological' symptoms)
- poor appetite w/ marked weight loss (>5% body weight in past month) w/o dieting; rarely inc appetite and weight gain
- disrupted sleep: initial insomnia or early waking (3+ hrs earlier than usual)
- psychomotor retardation (limited spontaneous movement or sluggish thought processes) or agitation (subjective feeling of restlessness)
- decreased libido (sexual drive) and other appetites
- evidence of (or subjective feelings of) reduced ability to concentrate
- feelings of worthlessness, inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional), or self-reproach; not just about current illness but also past decisions or events
- recurrent thoughts of death, suicide ideation or suicide attempts; may be passive or active

## Diagnosis
- symptoms must be present every or nearly every day w/o significant changes throughout day for over 2 weeks & represent change from normal personality w/o alcohol/drugs, medical disorders or bereavement
- must be at least 2 core symptoms
- plus 2 or more typical symptoms

differentials
- psychiatric disorders: bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa, anxiety
- substance misuse
- dementia
- sleep disorders
- neurological disorders
- physical illness
- medication SE

- often missed or ignored when pts (M>F) dismiss depressive symptoms as temporary or due to physical illness
- avoidance of psychiatric labels (often due to stigma attached to diagnoses) obstructs help-seeking behaviour

severity of depression
- for single (first) depressive episode
  - mild: 2 typical, 2 core
  - moderate: 2 typical, 3+ core
  - severe: 3 typical, 4+ core
- further depressive episodes = recurrent depressive disorder
- additional classification
  - somatic symptoms: biological features
  - psychotic symptoms: mood-congruent delusions or hallucinations
  - manic episodes: suggestive of bipolar 

## Management
- medication improves mood and inc synaptic availability of NA or 5-HT, part of holistic approach
- increasing activity
- improve sleep, relaxation, 'self-soothing' techniques
- work out what pts wants and support
- inactivity, drugs, alcohol, daytime TV, and isolation will perpetuate problem

- mild depression
  - low-intensity psychological interventsions
  - individual guided self-help, computerised CBT and structured group-based physical activity programmes
  - unless symptoms beyond 8 wks or previous history of depression, antidepressents should not be routinely used
- moderate depression
  - combination of antidepressant and high-intensity psychological intervention
  - Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme has been created to meet this need - it offers a realistic and routine first-line treatment across NHS
  - for first episode of depression - generic SSRI is recommended
- severe depression
  - includes psychotic depression, high risk of suicide, and atypical depression
  - need a rapid specialist mental health assessment w/ consideration of inpatient admission or ECT
- recurrent depression
  - 50-80% w/ moderate/severe -> further episodes
  - may require maintenance treatment to reduce relapse risk
  - intervene quickly and early any recurrence
  - if medication worked well once good chance of working again, should always be first line
  - continuing antidepressants lowers odds of relapse by ~65%, halving absolute risk
  - CBT to manage residual symptoms
  - psychoeduation around relapsing nature of condition is essential
  - normalise reoccurence

lifestyle change: eg exercise, tai chi, yoga, social interaction, rest from work etc

follow up
- all pts should be reviewed, freq at first and the less often, to consider their current symptomology and level of functioning
- investigate response to any interventions, adherence to treatments, and adverse effects - direct questioning and probing may be required to elicit 'embarrassing' or assumed unconnected complaints
- alongside this, consider: comorbid conditions w/ depression, suicide risk, and safeguarding concerns
- include psychoeducation on depression and recovery - promotion of lifestyle changes w/ ongoing reviews and reflection to highlight gains and maintain positive changes

st john's wort (hypericum perforatum)
- widely available
- Cochrane review: superiority to placebo and equal to antidepressents in major depression w/ fewer side effects (1/2 SSRIs)
- upregulates CYP3A4 cytochrome -> reducing oral contractive pill efficacy
- always ask if being taken

suicide risk/severe depression
- persistent low mood or anhedonia >2wks and >=4 out of 7 markers of severe depression, high risk of suicide:
  - Suicide plan or ideas of self-harm
  - Unexplained guilt or worthlessness
  - Inability to function
  - Concentration impaired
  - Impaired appetite
  - Decreased sleep/early waking
  - Energy low/unaccountable fatigue
- enquire whenevere depression possible; sensitively but directly about suicide
- urgently prescribed antidepressents in severe depressents
- over-diagnosing severe depression
  - medicalised and drugs w/ significant SE needlessly given
  - short assessment
  - NICE and QOF recommend using PHQ-9 diagnostic tool
