# Antidepressants

- helpful in major depression and preventing relapse
- often trial and error to find out works well

basic approach
- discuss choice of drug and non-pharmacological therapy; CBT is known to be as effective as antidepressants in mild-moderate depression; combined use is better than either treatment alone
- discuss side effects: warn pts of initial worsening of symptoms in first weeks so persevere before therapeutic effects are seen; remember to monitor closely during this time for increased suicidality; not all side effects are undesirable (SSRI may help premature ejaculation)
- assess formally after (at least) 4 weeks; if effective continue for at least 6 months after recovery, if stopped too soon 50% of pts relapse
- if there is minor/low response; titrate dose up looking for additional response; switching is better than augmenting although doctors combine medication if partial recovery on one drug
- if no response after 4wks or poor tolerability, switch to alternative class of antidepressant; do not continue to increase dose; little evidence for dose response except tricyclics, venlafaxine, and escitalopram

NICE guidance
antidepressants have largely equal efficacy and choice depends on
- side effect profile
- people's preference
- previous experience of treatments
- propensity of discontinuation symptoms
- safety in overdose
- interactions
- cost

- SSRIs recommended as first choice due to favourable risk-benefit rations
- neither escitalopram nor 'dual-action' antidepressants were judged to have any clinically important advantages

first line
    - generic SSRI, low dose, titrated up
    - full effect may take up to 6wks (initial positive effects likely placebo) and effective dose continued for at least 6 months after recovery
    - fluoxetine (only one licensed for <18s), citalopram (or escitalopram) or sertraline (best in IHD) all good choices in terms of safety, efficacy, and tolerability
    - monitor FBC (anaemia due to GI bleeding and avoid concurrent NSAIDs), U+E (hyponatraemia) in any SSRI
    - citalopram may be dose-dependent prolongation of QTC interval so check ECG (if unnoticed torsades de points)
    - discuss potential adverse effects and risks of discontinuation/withdrawal symptoms - including sexual side effects

second line: alternate SSRI from first line (all very different molecules)

third line
    - mirtazapine (NASSA) or venlafaxine (SNRI)
    - mirtazapine: drowsiness at low doses, can helpful to aid sleep when given evening dose, and can lead to weight gain
    - venlafaxine: more effective for pts who are anxious, but requires a baseline BP and ECG and monitoring for any CV SEs

fourth line
- Star* D trial, if medication ineffective, keep switching until find one that works
- lithium effective as adjunctive therapy but has significant toxicity problems
- consider older antidepressants
  - TCAs: nortriptyline, clomipramine
  - MAOIs: moclobemide, phenelzine
  - SARI: trazodone; whatever is used, review regularly

Mechanism of Action
- neurotransmitter receptor hypothesis: postulates change in receptor sensitivity by desensitisation and down-regulation of different receptors (not just inc NT at the synapse) leads to clinical effects after a few wks
- monoamine hypothesis of antidepressant on gene expression: suggests effect of increased NT at synapse initiates sequence of events to given the antidepressant response; includes up- and down-regulation of various genes w/ subsequent varying expression of receptors and critical proteins
