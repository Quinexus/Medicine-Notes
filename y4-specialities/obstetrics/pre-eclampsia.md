# Pre-eclampsia
HTN in pregnancy after 20wks w/ either proteinuria or evidence of systemic involvement which usually resolves by 6wks pp

## Background
5-8% pregnancies
major cause or morbidity (cerebral haemorrhage, multiorgan failure, ARDS) and mortality, and iatrogenic prematurity (only cure = delivery)
  
associated w/ failure of trophoblastic invasion of spiral arteries -> vasoactive 
- fetal growth restriction and placental failure
- inc BP for compensation
- affects hepatic, renal and coag

risk factors
- primiparity: risk 2x cf multips
- new paternity: protective effect of mulitp lost
- pre-eclampsia in previous pregnancy: recurrance 10-50% (higher if onset <30wks or severe disease, lower if late onset or mild)
- FH: risk 25% if mother had it; 33% if sister; genetic involvement
- BMI >30: inc risk
- age > 35: inc risk esp extremes of age but esp >35 and 40yrs (4x 25yro) possibly related to more comorbidities and reduced adaptability
- multiple pregnancy: morbidity and mortality higher from pre-eclampsia than singleton
- subfertilty: risks higher despite accounting for maternal age and other RFs; donor embryo risk ~50%
- gestation/chronic HTN: ~25%
- autoimmune disease: risk inc esp w/ antiphospholipid syndrom; can be difficult to distinguish flare
- renal disease: ~25% incidence

high risk
- previous severe or early-onset pre-eclampsia (<20wks)
- chronic HTN or HTN in previous pregnancy
- CKD
- DM
- autoimmune (SLE, antiphospholipid, thrombophilia)
moderate risk
- 1st pregnancy
- >=40yrs
- pregnancy interval >=10yrs
- BMI >=30
- FH pre-eclampsia
- multiple pregnancy
- low PAPP-A
- uterine artery notching on doppler at 22-24wks

fetal causes: hydatidiform mole, multiple pregnancy, fetal hydrops

## Presentation
symptoms: may be absent esp w/ mild
- headache
- flashing lights
- epigastric or RUQ pain
- N&V
- swelling of face, fingers and lower limbs

signs
- pregnancy-induced HTN
- proteinuria
- epigastric/RUQ tenderness
- brisk reflexes, >2 beats of clonus, confusion, fits
- placental abruption, IUGR, and still birth

effects:
- plasma volume dec
- peripheral resistance inc
- placental ischaemia
- if >180/140 microaneurysms in arteries
- DIC may develop; oedema may develop suddenly
- liver involvements -> HELLP syndrome w/ placental infarcts

severe complications: eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, cerebral haemorrhage, IUGR, renal failure and placental abruption

## Diagnosis
- systolic >140 or diastolic >90 and urine PCR >0.3md/dL
- absence of proteinuria
  - thrombocytopenia (<100 plts)
  - serum creatinine >88 or doubling in absence of renal disease
  - impaired liver function w/ elevated liver transaminases to twice normal concentration
  - pulmonary oedema
  - cerebral or visual disturbance
proteinuria can be very late or not present but multi-system involvement may be present

investigations
- urinalysis (reagent strip testing)
- PCR
- fetal ultrasound + umbilical artery dopplers (baby status)
- fetal CTG at diagnosis -> 2x/wk 
- FBC - anameia and thrombocytopenia; LFTs; renal function, coags (abnormal in severe)
- triage PlGF (placental growth factor) from 20-34+6/40 + clinical judgement and other tests -> diagnose ?pre-eclampsia and level of risk for associated delivery w/in 14 days of testing

##Â Management
depends on disease severity, should deliver on labour ward, NICE recommends admission but now mild is managed as outpatients
- mild:     
  - BP 140-149/90-99 PCR >0.3 diagnostic but nor severity reflecting
  - 4-hrly BP, 2x/wk bloods (renal, LFTs, FBC)
  - fetal growth scans 2x/wk
  - do not start anti-HTN unless BP >150/100
  - IOL after 37/40
- moderate
  - 150-159/100-109
  - admit until delivery
  - 4-hrly BP, 3x/wk bloods, 1x/2wks fetal scans and 2x/day CTG
  - start anti-HTNs
  - IOL at 37/40
- severe
  - >160/110 or symptoms/signs, or end-organ damage
  - senior help: obstetricians, anaesthetic, and midwifery staff
  - stabilise bp: nifedipine
  - if bp still high start IV anti-HTNs (labetalol or hydralazine)
  - prophylactic magnesium sulfate
  - bloods 12-24hrly
  - strict fluid balance, catheterise, steroids for fetal lung maturity
  - >34wks deliver
  - <34wks, time delivery according to senior guidance but generally needs if woman is stable, ideally 24-48h

prevention:
if 1 high-risk or 2 moderate-risk -> aspirin from 12th week until deliver
