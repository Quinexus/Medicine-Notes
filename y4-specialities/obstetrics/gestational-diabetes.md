# Diabetes Mellitus in Pregnancy


## Background
- ~5% pre-existing (T1/2) or GDM -> 87% GDM, 7% T1, 5% T2 due to rising obesity/age
- GDM: 3-6% incidence, 50% develop T2DM

## Presentation
- Risks
    - mother: hypo unawareness (T1 esp 1st tri) -> give warning; inc risk pre-eclampsia, infection and high rates LSCS
    - baby: miscarriage, malformation inc 3x (fetal sacral agensis rare; CNS/CVS more common); macrosomic -> shoulder dystocia/birth injury or growth restricted; polyhydramnious (?fetal polyuria); preterm labour; stillbirth


## Diagnosis
- OGTT (2h 75g) if 1st degree FH, previous macrosomia, BMI >30, ethnicity at 24-28wks
- fasting 5.6, OGTT 7.8
- DO NOT USE fasting plasma glucose (insulin resistance mediated), HbA1c (duration), urinalysis (glycosuria can occur w/o DM due to inc GFR and dec tubular glucose reabsorption) but can 1 occasion of 2+ or 2 occasions of 1+ shold be investigated
- HbA1c at diagnosis to check pre-existing T2DM

## Management
preconception conuselling for pre-existing
- avoid unplanned pregnancy & good control (contraception until)
- offer structured eduction
- folic acid 5mg daily until 12wks
- BMI <27kg/m2
- stop oral meds (except metoformin), statins, ACE & A2A inhibitors
- treat retinopathy pre-pregnancy - <=20% proliferative retinopathy, nephropathy worsens

treatment of pre-existing
- folic acid from preconception (5mg) and aspirin 75mg from 1st tri -> dec HTN
- measure HbA1c - risk of complications and consider repeating at 2nd/3rd tri
- insulin: rapid-acting > human insulin
- educate: monitor 1h postprandial and before bed; insulin increase by 50-100% so review regularly; aim fasting 5.3 w/o problematic hypo, 1h postprandial 7.8, 2h postprandial 6.4
- admit if control not achievable at home -> insulin pump consider
- hypo unawarness increases 1st trimester (tigheter blood glucose targets) - glucogel and glucagon kits
- exclude ketoacidosis if unwell - give capillary blood ketone strips to all women; check renal function; refer kidney specialist if Cr >120, protein excretion >2g/24h (VTE meds if >5g/24h)
- US: gestation confirm early 7-9wks; combined screening 12wks; anomaly scan 18-20wks

treatment of GDM
- diabetes-antenatal clinic, and dietician referal + 30mins exercise/day
- if targets not met 1-2wks -> metformin
- still not met -> insulin
- fasting >7 -> insulin
- macrosomia +/- polyhydramnios -> insulin (4wkly scans from 28wks)
- not tolerate metformin/target not met & insulin declined: glibenclamide

delivery considerations
- hospital
- elective at 37-38+6 wks w/ pre-existing and 40+6 uncomplicated GDM
- discussion of risks and benefits of induction, vaginal birth and CS if macrosomia (2-4x shoulder dystocia0
- preterm: steroids for lungs

labour
- continous fetal monitoring
- avoid hypo -> fetal hypo => use sliding scale if DM on insulin or CBG >7 in GDM; aim 4-7
- halve rate of infusion on delivery of placenta in T1
- insulin needs fall as labour progress and immediately pp -> stop infusions at delivery in GDM & T2DM if not on insulin pre-pregnancy -> return to pre-pregnancy

post-natal
- check fasting 6wks pp or HbA1c at 13wks pp and screen yrly
- encourage breastfeeding: insulin metformin & glibenclamide safe; can increase risk of materal hypo
- encourage prepregnancy counselling before next pregnancy
- preproliferative retinopathy -> opthal review for 6mnths
- discuss contraception
