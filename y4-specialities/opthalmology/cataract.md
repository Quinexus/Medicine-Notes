# Cataract

loss of transparency of lens

## Background
- leading cause of blindness worldwide
- RFs: age; early systemic or ocular disease; exposures: smoke, EtOH, UV, trauma, RT, HIV
- classification: by lens apperance
    - nuclear: change lens refractive index (='second sight' -> more myopic and regains reading vision), common old age
    - cortical: spoke-like wedge-shaped opacities with milder effects on vision
    - posterior subcapsular: typically progress faster and classic glare from lights (sunlight/night driving), troublesome even when visual acuity is only mildly affected
        - subcapsular opacities (e.g steroid use) are just deep to lens capsule in visual axis
        - dot opacities are common in normal lenses but are also seen fast-developing cataracts in diabetes or myotonic dystrophy
    
## Presentation
- clouded/blurred vision
- maybe asymptomatic if unilateral, but can affect distance judgement (stereopsis)
- b/l -> painless vision loss +/- dazzle +/- monocular diplopia
- driving night difficulties and haloes around street lights
- children - squint, white pupil or nystagmus(infants)/amblyopia

## Diagnosis
- red reflex (may not be present in immature)

## Management
- up-to-date refraction
- troubling symptoms (lifestyle, number-plate at 20m) offer surgery

- surgery risks:
    - 2% serious complications
    - dazzle/glare often remains
    - spectacles often needed post-op too for reading
- surgery
    - pre-op ocular biometry: measure curvature of cornea & length of eye to determine lens implant -> aim emmetropic/slighly myopic but depends on preference & pre-existing refraction
    - day case w/ local anaesthesia (injection/drops) can use general
    - 1. incision -> phacoemulsification (US -> cannula aspiration) -> empty lens capsule
    - 2. incision enlarged -> folded artificial lens implaned and unrolled into empy capsule
    - immediately return home afterwards and full activities resumed next day
    - complicated surgery/extracapsular extraction - larger incision and limitations
    - given Abx & anti-inflammatory drops 3-6wks post-op + change specs, multifocal intraocular lens can be helpful
- complications post-op
    - posterior capsule opacification common occurring ~20% over mnts-yrs -> capsulotomy w/ YAG laser outpt
    - astigmatism corrected during surgery using toric lens or incision in cornea (reduce steepness in one meridian)
    - endopthalmitis (<1/1000): painful red eye or loss of vision, same-day management w/ vitreous biopsy & intravitreal Abx
    - post-op eye irritation needing drops; dry/gritty sensations -> lubricants
    - rare: vitreous haemorrhage, retinal detachment, glaucoma (+/- permanent visual loss)
    - vision deteriorates w/ time -> ?prescription change or consider YAG laser capsulotomy and exclude others
- congenital cataract: urgent referral + surgery w/in latent period of visual development (1st 6wks of life) to prevent deprivation amblyopia; TORCH screen


- prevention/photoprotection
    - sunglasses (dec UV-b)
    - reduce oxidative stress
    - stop smoking
