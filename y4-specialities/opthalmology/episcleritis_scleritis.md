# Episcleritis & Scleritis
inflammation of episclera and sclera
- episcleritis: common, self-limiting, benign
- scleritis: v. painful, sight-threatening, systemic disease

## Background
- episcleritis > scleritis
- episcleritis
  - below conjunctiva in episclera
  - common
  - 70% women
  - b/l in 30%
  - focal vs diffuse
  - no cause in 70% but may occur in CT disease such as SLE
- scleritis
  - generalised inflammation of sclera w/ oedema of conjunctiva, scleral thinning, and vasculitic changes
  - divided into: anterior (90%) and posterior (10%)
  - necrotising variety can cause globe perforation
  - 50% have associated systemic disease

## Presentation
- red eye
- episcleritis
  - discomfort minor
  - acuity normal
- scleritis
  - deep severe pain of globe
  - constant, severe dull ache which 'bores' into eye and can wake them at night
  - ocular movements painful as muscles attach into sclera
  - may present w/ headache and photophobia

## Diagnosis
- scleritis vs episcleritis
  - episclera superficial: episcleral vessels move when probed w/ cotten bud and blanch w/ phenylephrine
  - deeper scleral vessels will not move or blanch

## Management
episcleritis: symptomatic relief mainstay w/ artificial tears and topical or systemic NSAIDs

scleritis
- urgent referral
- management guided by subtype
  - non-necrotising anterior scleritis: oral NSAIDs +/- oral high-dose pred
  - posterior scleritis or any necrotising scleritis: more aggresive therapy
  - systemic immunosuppression influence by underlying systemic disease; typically cyclophosphamide or rituximab and course of methylpred
  - recalcitrant disease may benefit from infliximab
  - imminent globe perforation requires surgical intervention
  - prognosis follows that of underlying systemic disorder
  - visual loss common in necrotising form
