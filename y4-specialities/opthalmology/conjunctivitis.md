# Conjunctivitis
inflamed w/ injection of the superficial vessels


## Background
non infectious causes: allergic conjunctivitis most frequent cause of all cases, affecting 15-40% of population; few seek medical attention

other cases
- toxic, autoimmune, neoplastic
- contact lens wearers may develop a reaction to lens presence
- be aware of conjunctivitis w/ shortening of fornices which may include abnormal conjunctival adhesions (symblephara), due to chronic (scarring) conjunctivitis, such as ocular mucous membrane pemphigoid
- scarring of lids and secondary damage to cornea can progress quickly w/ rapid b/l loss of vision, urgent specialist input needed

infectious causes
- non-herpetic viral (usually 'watery' serous discharge) most common infectious cause
- ~80% are adenoviruses (small lymphoid aggregates appear as follicles on conjunctiva) and can cause intense itching
- bacterial (purulent discharge more prominent, esp in gonococcal infection)

## Presentation
- diagnosed by ruling out sight-threatening features:
  - acuity
  - pupillary response
  - corneal lustre are unaffecting
- eyes itch, burn and lacrimate
- often b/l w/ discharge sticking lids together

##Â Diagnosis
conjunctival cultures only needed if suspect
- gonococcal/chlamydial infection
- neonatal conjunctivitis
- recurrent disease not responding to therapy

## Management
- most cases viral and only symptomatic relief w/ artificial tears and cold compresses
- topic antiviral treatment does not help
- topical Abx supposedly prevent 2o bacterial infection
- viral conjunctivitis is highly contagious so educate pts on hand and face washing
- bacterial conjunctivitis also tends to be self-limiting (60%) w/in 1-2wks; topical antibiotics dec duration of symptoms and transmission risk
- Abx drops esp useful in culture-proven bacterial conjunctivitis
- start Abx immediately if ?sexual disease, contact lens wearers, or immunocompromised
- chloramphenicol often used (or fusidic acid)
- staphylococci common causes
- prolonged conjunctivitis esp young adults, consider chlamydial infection get expert help
- allergic conjunctivitis
  - antihistamine drops
  - refer if not settling
  - steroid drops (after advice from opthalmologist) may help
