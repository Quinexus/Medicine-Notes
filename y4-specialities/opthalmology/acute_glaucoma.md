# Acute Closed-Angle Glaucoma

## Background
- angle of anterior chamber narrows acutely -> IOP rise (>=30, normal 12-21)
- pupil fixed and dilated
- axonal death
- inc IOP -> hard eye

- primary angle-closure = anatomical predisposition
- secondary = pathological processes eg trauma
  - precipitating factors: dilating drops

incidence: 40-60, asia

## Presentation
- unwell
- N&V
- acute medical team
- 25% acute uniocular attacks - headache and painful red eye, preceded by blurred vision or haloes around lights at night
- onset: hours-days
- ! send to eye unit now


## Diagnosis
- measure IOP

## Management
- bb: suppress aqueous humour production
- pilocarpine: miosis opens a blocked 'closed' drainage angle
- IV acetazolamide: dec aqueous formation
- analgesia + antiemetics
- admit to measure IOP
- peripheral iridotomy (laser/surgery) done in both eyes once IOP controlled (rarely as emergency if IOP uncontrolled)
  - hole -> breaks cycle -> reduces pressure -> drainage angle to open again

complications
- visual loss
- central retinal artery or vein occlusions
- repeated episodes
