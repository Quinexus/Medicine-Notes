# Anterior Uveitis

## Background
- visual impairment in people of working age
- most common: acute anterior uveitis (iritis)

types & causes
- anterior uveitis
    - ank spon, reactive arthritis, IBD
    - sarcoid, behcets
    - juvenile idiopathic arthritis
    - herpes simplex/zoster, TB, syphilis, HIV
    - tarantula hairs
- intermediated uveitis: MS, sarcoid, lymphoma
- posterior uveitis
    - herpes simplex/zoster; toxoplasmosis; TB; CMV; bacterial/fungal endopthalmitis
    - lymphoma, sarcoidosis
    - behcet's

pathophysiology
anterior: primary site of inflammation is iris + ciliary body
intermediate: vitreous
posterior: choroid (+ retina)
panuveits: all

intermediate, posterior, pan <<< anterior
- painless & blurred vision/floaters, not usually red
- eye typical not red
- ocular imaging = fundus fluorescein & indocyanine green-angiography -> check retinal and choroidal disease
- topical treatments do not penetrate sufficiently posteriorly -> systemic or intraocular therapy; NICE approved adalimumab and two intra-vitreal steroid implants
- visual loss common in uveitis due to: cystoid macular oedema, glaucoma, cataracts, chorioretinal scarring, choroidal neovascular membranes, retinal detachment, and vitreous opacities

## Presentation
- classical: pain, blurred vision & photophobia
- red eye starts w/ conjunctival injection around junction of cornea & sclera and increased lacrimation (no sticky discharge, unlike in conjunctivitis)
- pupil: may be simple, initially from iris spasm; later may be irregular due to adhesions between lens & lens (synechiae)
- onset: hours/days
- check features of systemic disease

## Diagnosis
- slit lamp w/ dilated pupil to visualise location of inflammatory cells: anterior uveitis can see leucocytes in anterior chamber

## Management
- urgent eye clinic referral
- use slit lamp to monitor inflammation; may replase so regular eye clinic care and follow-up is vital
- drops:
    - topicla corticosteroids
    - cyclopentolate: prevent adhesions lens & iris and relive spasms of ciliar body -> keep pupil dilated (unless very mild)
- aim to prevent damage from prolonged inflammation: synechia disrupts flow of aqueous -> glaucoma +/- adhesions between iris & lens
- involve MDT if systemic disease as controlling underlying disease is key
