# A to E assessment

## Airway

- Consider CXR, ABG, peak flow, nebuliser

## Circulation

- ASSESSMENT - Pulse Rate/Rhythm, Blood Pressure, Heart sounds, Perfusion, Capillary Refill, JVP, Oedema
- INVESTIGATION and INTERVENTION - IV access, blood tests, IV fluids, 3/12 lead ECG, ACS
- IV Fluid Bolus = 500ml (130-154 mmol/L Na+) crystalloid/<15 min

## Disability

Five Point Disability Check
1. AVPU/GCS - What does the patient respond to? A - Alert, V - Voice, P - Pain, U - Unresponsive
2. Pupils
3. Lateralising Neurology
4. Neck Stiffness
5. DEFG - Don't ever forget GLUCOSE

## UL/LL Neuro

In The Pouring Rain She Came = Inspection, Tone, Power, Reflexes, Sensation, Coordination

- Inspect - SWIFT = Scarring, Wasting, Involuntary movement, Fasciculations, Tremor
- Tone - leg roll, leg lift, ankle clonus
- Power
	- UL - shoulder abduction, shoulder adduction, elbow extension, elbow flexion, wrist extension, wrist flexion, finger extension, finger abduction, thumb abduction
	- LL - hip & knee flexion/extension, ankle dorsiflexion/plantarflexion, big toe extension

	- UL - biceps, supinator, triceps
	- LL - knee-jerk, ankle-jerk, plantar-reflex
- Sensation - light touch, pin-prick, vibration, proprioception
- Coordination - finger-to-nose/heel-to-shin test, dysdiadochokinesia

For UL - pronator drift
For LL - Gait, Romberg's test

## GALS Screening

1. Questions - pain/stiffness in muscles, joints or back; difficulty getting dressed; any problem going up and down stairs
2. Inspection
3. Gait
4. Arms 
	Compound movements - hands behind head, hands held out in front palms facing down, hands held out in front palms facing up, making a fist, grip strength, precision grip
	MCP joint squeeze
5. Legs
	Passive movements - passive knee flexion, passive hip flexion, passive internal rotation of hip
	MTP joint squeeze
	Patellar tap
6. Spine
	Trapezius tenderness
	Cervical lateral flexion
	Lumbar flexion
7. Temporomandibular joint - ROM and deviation of jaw movement

## REMS

Look - all angles, symmetry, bony deformities, muscle wasting/bulk, swelling, skin changes, scars
